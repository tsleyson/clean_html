;; You don't need fixtures for stuff that doesn't change. None of this

;; functional data structures, so a :once fixture or just top-level
;; def is fine.

;; Note: none of these tests cover config files that have cleaner
;; functions. The reason is that the cleaner function is assigned an
;; internal ID number every time it's read it, so it's not possible to
;; compare them. I don't think it matters, but there's probably some
;; way to make it compare the doc strings to be sure they're the same function.
