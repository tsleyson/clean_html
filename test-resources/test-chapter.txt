Since I didn't live in Santa Robles, I had no idea what the locals called this area; I had just decided it was \"the nightlife area\" because in practice, that seemed to be what it was. I could have just as easily come up with some quasi-clever name like \"Drunkard's Alley\" or \"Circus Brain-Minimus\" that would sound better in a book, and make me look quasi-clever for coming up with it, but in the end, quasi-cleverness isn't something I aspire to, and \"the nightlife area [around the college]\" was a name I wouldn't have to explain to other people who didn't live near the college if I happened to mention it. As a test of this principal, I had tried complaining to both Lucy and Sue that everyone in my class was more interested in spending time in the nightlife area around the college than learning anything, and both of them had passed over the name without question before telling me to stop acting like a bigshot honor student when I had left high school with a 1.9 GPA. On the other hand, when I tried telling my other sister Mia that everyone in my class was more interested in spending time in Circus Brain-Minimus than learning anything, she looked at me weird and went away without saying anything."]})}

I would probably agree that most places where people speak Farsi need more women's rights, but telling me about it wasn't going to solve anything, and neither was getting drunk and then getting kicked out of the bar by the bouncer for pretending to trip on a spilled cocktail and sticking your nose up a woman's skirt as you got up, which he had admitted to doing, then fiercely denied ever thinking of doing.
