// This is an example config file. It shows how to:
// - Pick which files to involve.
// - Point out where they are.
// - Say whether to merge them or not.
// - Define an ordering on your files to be merged.
// - Specify a transformation on the html file.
// If you don't give the files in here the program will ask
// where they are. That way it's possible to write a config
// for Microsoft Word and give it out to people who don't
// know how to write config files. They can enter the
// file directory and apply the same transformations over and
// over again.

// I want to make it possible to specify the order without having to type
// out every file. Maybe add a regex or something to extract a part
// of the chapter name to order by. It wouldn't help for e.g.
// Strawberry Sunflower, but for a lot of cases it would.
// It might also be nice to make it possible to give a table of
// contents with the ordering set in HTML attributes. But we're getting
// ahead of ourselves; for now just stick with this.

// Directory must be either an absolute path or relative to your classpath.
// Only the files listed in order's array will be read. This lets you ignore
// some of the files in the directory.
// merge can be set to false or just absent. If we made this available
// as as web service, it could be useful to be able to set it false from code.
