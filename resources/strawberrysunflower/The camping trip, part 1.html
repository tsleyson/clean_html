<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=4><B>The
camping trip, part 1. By Nora.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Since
our tests only took four days to finish, we got to start our weekend
on Friday. On Monday, Cora and I were going to find out that we'd
both failed math and were going to have  to do extra tutoring with
Miss Hanover, but on Thursday afternoon we still didn't know and were
ready to just relax and have fun over the weekend.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I
got to the clubroom earlier than Lily and Cora, as usual. Most of the
time, I'm alone for about twenty minutes while I wait for them, but
today Ranta had come to visit. I found her sitting at the table
reading a book.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Hi
Nora,&quot; she said when I came in. &quot;How were your tests?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Okay,&quot;
I said. &quot;Math probably wasn't very good, but everything else
seemed fine. What're you reading?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;It's
<I>In Memoriam</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">,&quot; said
Ranta.</SPAN><I> &quot;</I>Alfred Lord Tennyson wrote it for his best
friend, who died. It's sad, but really good. It makes me wish I had a
friend who would write a beautiful poem for me after I died.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Ranta
is really nice. Even though she's a sports girl like Cora, she also
likes to read, so it's fun to talk about books with her. I haven't
had that many chances to be alone with her, since we're in different
classes; sometimes we meet up in the library, but otherwise we only
see each other when Cora is around, and Cora fights with Ranta, so
it's hard to talk to her then.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I
don't know how beautiful it would be,&quot; I said, &quot;but I could
write a poem for you if you...&quot; I started to get embarrassed and
looked down, hiding my face behind my bangs.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Ranta
looked surprised, but happy. &quot;Thank you, Nora,&quot; she said.
&quot;That's sweet of you to say, but I don't plan to die anytime
soon.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;N-no,
of course not...&quot; I thought about hiding behind the curtains,
but I decided to make tea instead, to calm myself down. Lily always
kept some nice tea in the clubroom. I filled the self-heating kettle
and started it off.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I
had made tea, served Ranta and myself, and started reading my own
book, when Lily came in with another girl and a teacher. The teacher
was Mrs. Julian, one of the science teachers. Everyone liked her a
lot; her specialty was geology, so she taught us a lot about rocks
and minerals, though we also learned some chemistry and a little
paleontology from her. That's the study of animals and plants that
lived a long time ago, like dinosaurs; after they died, their bodies
were preserved as fossils that people can dig up and study to learn
what they were like.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Oh,
good, Ranta, you're here,&quot; said Lily. &quot;Maria and Mrs.
Julian came to ask us for a favor.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Our
geology club is going on a field trip this weekend,&quot; said Mrs.
Julian. &quot;We're going to the mountains north of the school to
look at some rock formations, and we'll be camping out.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;There
are only twelve of us in the club,&quot; said Maria, &quot;and three
are little, so we wanted some more help carrying things and setting
up camp and cooking, and watching the little kids. So I decided to
ask Lily for help.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;You
don't have to come,&quot; said Lily, &quot;but we could use the extra
help. I was hoping you'd come, Ranta, since you're so athletic and
level-headed. Of course, we could use your help too, Nora.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I'm
up for it,&quot; said Ranta. &quot;It's been a while since I went
camping.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I'll
come too,&quot; I said.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Good!
Thank you so much,&quot; said Maria. &quot;We'll get everything ready
and leave tomorrow morning at nine. There's a van driving us up, so
meet at the front gates.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I
was pretty excited. I had never gone camping before, and I was going
to get some time to get to know Ranta better. Maybe if we got to know
each other well enough, Ranta would become my second friend at St.
Galgani's. I was hoping for that to happen.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Cora
came in later, and we asked her if she wanted to come, but she said
she couldn't. &quot;My parents want me to come home this weekend,&quot;
she said. &quot;They're coming to pick me up tomorrow and bring me
back.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Too
bad, I want to see Cora's parents,&quot; I said. &quot;I've never
seen a grown-up cat person.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;They
just look like me, but bigger and older,&quot; said Cora. &quot;There's
nothing special about them. Now, my big brother, he's the one you
want to see. You'll fall in love at first sight, I guarantee it!&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Oh,
a big brother rivalry?&quot; said Ranta. &quot;I'll take that
challenge.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Well,
if you really want to see him so much, here,&quot; said Cora, taking
her wallet from her pocket and handing it to Lily. Inside she had
pictures of her family. &quot;These are my parents, and this is my
baby sister, and here's my big brother.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Cora's
parents looked a lot like her, especially her father. He wore glasses
and had the same orange-and-white hair and ears that she did. Her
mother was very beautiful, with a thin face and high cheekbones; her
ears and hair were grey, like a koala. Cora's baby sister, who I
guessed was about four, was like an adorable miniature copy of her,
though she didn't wear glasses and had a gap in her front teeth.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Cora's
big brother also looked a lot like her. He also wore glasses,
although he had his mother's grey hair and ears and thin face, which
made him look noble and princely. He was scowling, like Cora often
did, and his eyes were narrow and somehow angry. He was handsome,
that was for sure, but he was also kind of scary, and I wasn't
falling in love at first sight as Cora had guaranteed.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Does
your brother go to school here?&quot; asked Lily.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;No,
he's in medical school right now. He's smart, and he has the Gift of
Soothing, so he decided to try and become a pediatrician. He's
nothing like me,&quot; said Cora. &quot;I'm stupid, and if I tried to
take care of kids, I'd just yell and make them cry. I really admire
him.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Ranta
made a snorting sound, and Cora turned on her. &quot;So, you said
something about a big brother challenge? Did you just realize that my
big brother is cooler and tougher than yours? Come on, tell us what
he's doing. I can't wait to hear how he sits on a couch all day and
has grapes fed to him by servants.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;He
goes to school here,&quot; said Ranta. &quot;He's in the high school.
In...the theater club. He makes costumes for them.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Oh,
so Aurelio is your brother,&quot; said Lily.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;He
goes by Rel, just like I go by Ranta,&quot; said Ranta. &quot;My full
name is Amaranta.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Cora
burst out laughing, although I thought 'Amaranta' was a nice name,
and said so.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Thank
you, Nora,&quot; said Ranta.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I
agree,&quot; said Cora. &quot;It's such a nice name, that from now on
I'm going to call you Amaranta all the time.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Cora's
parents weren't going to be there until ten or so, so she came down
to the gate to see us off.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I
had packed two pairs of jeans and two T-shirts, along with a water
bottle, some granola bars, a sewing kit, and my pillow. It had taken
me a month to get used to the pillow in my dorm room when I first
came, and I wasn't going to go back now. I also packed two books,
<I>White Fang </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">and </SPAN><I>The
Jungle Book</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">,
just in case there was time for me to read.</SPAN></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Cora
and Ranta met me in the dining hall for breakfast. They fought all
through breakfast as usual, with Cora calling Ranta by her full name
and making fun of Ranta's brother for being a dressmaker. I was so
tired of listening to it that I left breakfast early and started down
to the front gates without them.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	There
was a guard on duty at the gatehouse. I told him I was going on the
camping trip with Mrs. Julian, and he found my name on the list she
had given him and let me through the gates into the parking lot. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	The
van was parked at the middle of the lot, with all the doors open and
the camping equipment sitting around it. A man who I assumed was the
driver of the van was loading everything up. Lily wasn't there yet
when I arrived, but Maria and Mrs. Julian were, along with the rest
of the club. As Maria had said, three of the members were little
kids&mdash;two second graders and a first grader&mdash;and the
others, aside from Maria herself and one other girl, were third
graders. Mrs. Julian was trying to keep the little kids in line when
I came up, but Maria saw me and waved. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Sorry,
what was your name again?&quot; she asked when I got to her.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;N-Nora,&quot;
I said.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Thank
you again for agreeing to come help us.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;It's
n-no trouble, I've n-never been camping before, so it ought to be
f-fun.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Maria
smiled and introduced me to Francine, a sixth grader with curly
blonde hair and kind of a horsey face. &quot;Francine is the one
who's most excited about this trip,&quot; said Maria.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;The
other kids are just here to have fun,&quot; said Francine, &quot;so
we could have just gone somewhere nearby to camp, but I really wanted
to see these rock formations. They're made from igneous rock that
dates back to the time of the dinosaurs. I thought Lily might like to
come and see the plants and trees, and we needed the extra help, so I
asked her.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Oh,
you're the one who asked Lily,&quot; I said. &quot;How did you meet
her?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Last
year, I was failing science,&quot; said Francine. &quot;Miss Hanover
asked Lily to tutor me. Thanks to her, I found out that rocks are
interesting and decided to join this club.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I
didn't think that rocks were all that interesting, but I did think
that books were interesting, and I knew that it didn't feel good when
Cora said they were dumb and made her head hurt, so I didn't say
anything about that to Francine. &quot;I didn't know that Lily liked
science,&quot; I said.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Lily
is a genius at science! Of course she's good at botany, but she's
incredible at all kinds of science,&quot; said Francine. &quot;Before
she helped me, I thought science was just boring and dumb, like math,
but Lily showed me that wasn't true.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Now
that I thought about it, there had been a few science questions in
our study sessions which had stumped me, Ranta, and Cora, and Lily
had come in and helped us. I hadn't thought about it much; she was
older than us and had already done it all when she was in sixth
grade. But then, she must have done fractions too, but she was too
afraid to even try and help us with those.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Are
you guys talking about me?&quot; Lily asked as she came up, wearing
her garden overalls and a big straw hat and carrying her leather
satchel and a backpack. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Francine
was telling me how much you helped her in science, and how she would
never have known how fun it was without you,&quot; I said.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;All
I did was show you what was in front of you the whole time,&quot;
said Lily. &quot;They say you can lead a horse to water, but you
can't make him drink. All I did was lead you to water.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	At
first I thought Lily had said something mean about Francine, but
Francine laughed and made a neighing sound, so this must have been
some joke between them. That had to be it; it was so unlike Lily, who
was always so nice to everyone, to say anything mean.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	On
the other hand, there was Cora, now approaching with Ranta, whose
every word was something mean about someone. I was a little bit glad
that she wasn't coming.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Ranta
had worn jeans and a baseball jacket that was a bit too big for her,
and was carrying her belongings in a duffel bag. It made her look
somehow grown up that she was carrying a duffel bag instead of a
backpack like the rest of us. She always looked so mature compared to
me and Cora, even though she was in the same grade. &quot;Is
everything loaded up?&quot; she asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Just
a few things left,&quot; said Maria.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Lily
and Ranta helped the driver load the rest of the equipment, and after
Cora had said her last 'Amaranta' for the day, we all got into the
van and got going. It was a huge van, with three bench-like seats,
each one able to hold four people. Mrs. Julian sat in the front with
the driver, while I was squeezed into the second seat between Ranta
and Francine, with Lily on Francine's right next to the aisle. Maria
sat in the back with the little kids to help keep them under control.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Francine
and Lily talked for a long time about the rocks and plants they were
going to see when we got to the campsite. I didn't understand a lot
of what they were saying; they both knew a lot more about science
than I did, just like Ranta and I knew more about books than most
kids our age. I listened to what they were saying for a while,
following along as best as I could, as they talked about igneous
rocks and geothermal vents and coniferous forests.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Do
you like science too, Nora?&quot; Francine asked when she noticed I
was listening.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;It's
not my favorite subject, but it's okay,&quot; I said. &quot;Listening
to you and Lily talk, it makes me feel like science might be a lot
more interesting than I ever thought.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	After
that, Ranta and I talked about books for a while and let Francine and
Lily continue their conversation about science. Even though the
little kids were loud, it was a peaceful trip without Cora, and I
enjoyed being able to talk to Lily and Ranta as much as I wanted.
Talking to Francine was also fun; even though she liked science and I
liked books, I felt like we were similar in a way. Most people make
me a little bit nervous when I first meet them, and I stutter a
little while talking to them, but from the very beginning, I hadn't
stuttered at all while talking to Francine.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	We
arrived at Ash Mountains Park around noon, and everyone got out of
the van. Once we had unloaded the supplies and the driver had said
goodbye and driven off, the little kids ran around yelling in the
parking lot while Mrs. Julian explained to the older kids what we
were going to do. &quot;We have to walk to the campsite from here,&quot;
she said, &quot;and it takes about an hour. First we'll eat lunch at
the restaurant here. I have club funds to pay for everyone, so don't
worry if you didn't bring money. Then we'll get going. Maria and I
will go first, with the younger children and Francine and Lily in the
middle. Nora and Ranta, please bring up the rear and make sure none
of the little kids leave the group.&quot; She gave us all maps of the
forest that showed the campsite where we would be staying. &quot;Does
anyone know how to use a compass?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I
do,&quot; said Ranta, so Mrs. Julian gave her one.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	The
restaurant was inside the visitor's complex of the park, a big wooden
building perched on the edge of a gulch. The restaurant had both
inside and outside tables; the outside tables were on a wooden deck
that overlooked a pine forest and a lake nestled deep down in the
valley. A waterfall sprayed down from the peak across from us and
came crashing down into the lake at the bottom. I was so impressed
with the view that I don't even remember what I ate. While the little
kids were finishing up, I took a pencil and notebook out of my
backpack and started trying to write a poem about the lake, something
like what William Wordsworth would write if he had been there to see
it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	It
was one o' clock by the time we finished with lunch, and everyone got
ready to set out for the campsite. Mrs. Julian and the older kids
split up the bigger equipment, like the tents and chairs and cooking
equipment, but we took some of the smaller things and put them in
little bags and satchels and gave them to the children. Then we set
out down the forest trail, Mrs. Julian and Maria at the head of a
herd of noisy kids, kept in line by Francine and Lily, with me and
Ranta at the end of the line.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	The
forest was beautiful. There were pines and redwoods, their trunks as
wide as cars, stretching up to the skies like towers, as tall as any
skyscraper. The forest floor was littered with pine needles and pine
cones, but the trail was mostly clear. We passed from sunny areas
with no trees to shady areas where the sunlight all came to us
filtered through the leaves of huge trees that had been here for
hundreds of years before we were born, and would still be here
hundreds of years after we had died. I wanted to try writing a poem
about it, but we were walking, and I was carrying my backpack and a
folding chair, so I couldn't even have written and walked at the same
time. I started writing the poem down in my mind, trying to remember
exactly the words that came to me while I was there, although it
hadn't worked so well with the speech I'd wanted to make on my first
day of class.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;This
place makes me think of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,&quot; Ranta
commented as we walked. &quot;The forest primeval, and Hiawatha. Have
you read him, Nora?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Yes,&quot;
I said, wanting to say more, but I was starting to run out of breath.
It had been a long time since I'd walked for this long, and I was
having a hard time keeping up. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Are
you all right?&quot; Ranta asked.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I'm
sorry. I'm just not used to walking this much,&quot; I said.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Don't
worry about it. Do you want to rest for a minute? We'll catch up to
the others later.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	The
others were already getting pretty far ahead, but I did need a rest.
I sat down on a log at the edge of a high hill and took a few deep
breaths. &quot;It sure is nice out here,&quot; I said. &quot;I could
just sit in this spot forever and listen to the wind in the trees.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;We'd
better start catching up,&quot; said Ranta. &quot;They're almost out
of sight.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I
started to stand up, but then something really unlucky happened: I
felt my foot slide on the pine needles that littered the hillside. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I&mdash;I'm
slipping!&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Ranta
grabbed my hand, and we probably would have been all right, except
that then the dirt under the pine needles chose that moment to
collapse.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I
tumbled backwards, trying to pull myself back up by Ranta's hand,
pulling her back with me. We landed on the hillside and I felt myself
rolling downwards on my side like a ball down a slide, Ranta beside
me.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	When
we finally hit the bottom, my head was spinning, and I had a few
bruises on my arms where I'd rolled over rocks, and my shirt was full
of pine needles, but I wasn't hurt. Ranta had landed nearby and also
didn't seem to be hurt.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I,
I'm sorry!&quot; I cried. &quot;I'm so sorry!&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Ranta
picked herself and dusted herself. &quot;It's, it's okay,&quot; she
said. &quot;It was an accident.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I'm
just sorry that I pulled you down with me,&quot; I said. &quot;Now
we're both stuck down here.&quot; The hill was quite steep, and it
looked unstable, so I didn't think we could climb back up it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;We
have the map and the compass. We'll find the campsite,&quot; said
Ranta. Our packs had tumbled down the hill with us&mdash;at least,
mine had, since it had been sitting next to me on the hill and had
fallen along with the pine needles and dirt, and Ranta had been
holding hers when I'd dragged her down with me&mdash;so we also had a
little food and water. And Ranta was with me, and she seemed reliable
and strong, so I wasn't very worried about getting to the campsite.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Two
hours later, we still hadn't found the campsite.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Neither
of us could make any sense of the map, which was so full of
topographical symbols and orienteering jargon that we couldn't even
begin to figure out where we were. Also, the visitor's center wasn't
on it, so we didn't have any point of reference. There was nothing on
the map that we knew except that campsite, and that wasn't any help
since that was what we were trying to find.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	And
it turned out that Ranta didn't know how to use a compass after all.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I'm
sorry,&quot; she said, sitting down and staring around us in defeat.
&quot;My dad showed me how to use one when we went camping, but I
never actually did it, so it looks like I forgot everything he said.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;That's
all right. It's my fault for getting us into this in the first
place,&quot; I said.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Well,
come on, let's see if we can get ourselves out of this,&quot; said
Ranta. &quot;I don't know if we can find the campsite before dark, so
let's see if we can find any shelter for the night. Dangerous things
come out in this forest at nighttime, so if we can find a cabin or
something, that would be best.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;What
kind of dangerous things?&quot; I asked, starting to be afraid.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Pine
cats, mostly. They're like racoons crossed with leopards. There are
also bears, though I think the wardens drive them away from the areas
where people camp. And the coyotes are too cowardly to bother people.
So mostly pine cats, I think. But they climb, so we're not safe in
trees.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;If
Cora were here, she might be able to talk them into leaving us
alone,&quot; I said.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;More
likely they'd eat us just to shut her up,&quot; said Ranta. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	We
walked for a while longer. We'd lost the trail, so it was hard to
tell one part of the forest from another. For all I knew, we were
just walking in circles. I started to wonder if I should mark the
trees just to make sure that wasn't happening, but after a while I
realized it wasn't happening, because the tree cover was getting
thicker as we moved ahead. Even though the sun was still high, the
sky got darker the further we went in the direction we were going. I
started to think of the direction ahead as the dark direction, and
the direction behind as the light direction.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I
couldn't walk anymore, so we stopped to rest for a minute, and Ranta
took out the map. &quot;I think I know where we are!&quot; she said
suddenly. &quot;Look.&quot; She showed me the map. &quot;See how the
little tree pictures are closer together here?&quot; she said,
pointing. &quot;I think that means the forest gets thicker. And this
light-colored ring probably means higher elevation, which makes sense
because we fell down that hill, so we're at a lower elevation now
than we were before.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>
&quot;So we overshot the campsite,&quot;
I said, pointing to it on the map. &quot;It's over here, and we're
way over here, to the west of it.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Yes.
I don't think we can walk all that way before night falls. I'm
starting to get pretty tired, so even if I carried you, I don't think
we could go that far.&quot; Neither of us could figure out how far it
actually was, since the map was so hard to read, but it looked pretty
far.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;What's
this?&quot; I asked, pointing to a little house icon that was on the
map to the north of where we thought we were.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Don't
know. It's not a campsite, since those have tents on them. But it
must be some kind of place with people, and it looks pretty close to
here, so I think we should go there and see if we can find help.
Maybe they can let us stay there for the night, or maybe they can
guide us to the campsite.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	It
turned out it wasn't somewhere with people.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	With
no better ideas, we made for the house icon on the map. The forest
got thicker and darker as we went, until it finally got so dark that
we could barely see the map anymore. At that point it was too late to
change our minds, so we kept making for the house.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	When
we finally got there, it wasn't a house at all. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Inside
a cluster of old, twisted oaks which had twined together to form
something that looked like a roof, someone had built a temple. At
least, I decided it was a temple because I couldn't imagine what else
it could be for. The holes between the twisted trunks of the oaks had
been covered over with boards from the inside, and the leaves, along
with bushes and branches of other trees, had grown over to cover the
rest of the grove inside the cluster of oaks. An opening had remained
between the branches, like a door; it was too dark to see far inside
it. The oaks grew into the side of a hill, which enclosed the temple
at the back.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;This
is a disappointment,&quot; said Ranta. &quot;I wonder if anyone's
here?&quot; She walked up to the door of the temple and knocked on
one of the trunks. &quot;Hello? Anyone here?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	There
was no answer.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I
can't tell if it's dark because it's almost night or if these trees
are just blotting out the sun,&quot; said Ranta, starting to sound
frustrated. &quot;What do you think, Nora? This place is probably
okay protection from pine cats. We could stay here the night. Or we
could try to make it to camp.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I
don't like it here,&quot; I said, &quot;but I don't know if I can
make it all the way to camp.&quot; It had taken us about thirty
minutes to walk here since discovering it on the map, and according
to the map, the campsite was about four times as far. After all, we
had spent two hours walking away from the campsite before we'd
figured out how to read the map.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Then
let's stay the night here,&quot; said Ranta. &quot;I have a blanket
and some trail mix in my duffel bag. What about you?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I
have my pillow, some water, and a few granola bars,&quot; I said. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Then
let's stop for the night. Tomorrow we can make it to the campsite.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Both
Ranta and I had flashlights with us, so we spent some time exploring
the grove of twisted oaks where we intended to sleep that night. It
wasn't very big on the inside, but it was pretty tall&mdash;the roof
was about as high as the classroom back at the academy. There were
several large cracks in the hill at the far end, but they looked too
small for bears or pine cats to live in, so Ranta wasn't worried
about them.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I
wonder who built it,&quot; said Ranta. &quot;And why.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Could
it have been druids?&quot; I asked.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Could
be. Or Iroquois, maybe.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	We
both read too much, I know, but it turned out that what had built
that grove was even more bizarre than druids or Iroquois.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	As
night fell, we both drank some water and ate some granola bars and
trail mix, and built a little bed to sleep in from what we had.
Ranta's blanket wasn't big enough to wrap around both of us on top
and bottom, so we laid it out on the dry leaves, and put my pillow on
top to share. As darkness fell, we laid down together to go to sleep.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	The
trees were so thick, and the temple roof so enclosing, that I
couldn't see a single star or one solitary beam of moonlight. Even
though it's hard to sleep when it's too light, it can be even harder
to sleep when it's too dark, especially if you're somewhere
unfamiliar or scary, so I laid there in the dark, opening and closing
my eyes. It was almost lighter with my eyes closed.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	After
a while I felt Ranta's arms wrap around my shoulders. &quot;Are you
cold?&quot; I asked. It was a little chilly.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;No.
Scared,&quot; she admitted. &quot;It's so dark...&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Me
too,&quot; I said. &quot;Ranta, I'm so sorry for getting you into
this.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>
&quot;No, don't be,&quot; said Ranta. &quot;When we
get out of here, we'll look back on this and laugh. It'll be a good
memory from the early days of our friendship.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;You&mdash;you
think of me as your friend? Even though you have so many other
friends who never dragged you down a hill and got you lost in the
wilderness?&quot; I asked.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Of
course. None of my other friends has ever gotten me into anything
this exciting,&quot; said Ranta. &quot;Just don't tell Cora I said I
was scared.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Okay.
I'll make sure she never knows,&quot; I promised.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	At
that moment, I heard something shuffle across leaves in the darkness.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I
heard something clicking.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Ranta...something's
here.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Don't
make fun of me. I didn't think you were like that, Nora,&quot; said
Ranta.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I'm
not...something's really here.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Eyes
were staring at us from the darkness. Glowing red eyes.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Eight
glowing red eyes.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I
screamed.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Ranta
grabbed me and pulled me up, dragging me through the door of the
temple to the outside. &quot;What is it?!&quot; I asked.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I
don't know.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Outside,
the tiniest amount of moonlight was managing to make it through the
trees. The thing came to the door of the temple, and I could just
barely make out the outline of something huge and hairy, something
black, something the size of a small horse, with eight legs and eight
eyes and long fangs.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	It
was a giant spider.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I
was about to scream again, but I managed to stop myself. &quot;Hide,&quot;
Ranta whispered roughly. &quot;Go off into the forest and hide. Once
the spiders are gone, start making for the campsite&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;What
about you?&quot; I whispered back.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I'll
distract it.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Just
as she said that, a second spider appeared in the doorway of the
temple, its huge fangs, like a pair of kitchen knives, clicking
together murderously.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Go!&quot;
said Ranta, and I went. I ran around the side of the temple and knelt
down among the branches, hoping the darkness would hide me.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Ranta
turned on the flashlight. &quot;Hey!&quot; she screamed, jumping up
and down and waving it above her head. &quot;Tasty fly, over here!
Come on, spiders! Come get me!&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	The
spiders went after Ranta, and she turned and ran off into the trees.
She ran, and the spiders followed, leaving me alone in the dark
forest.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I
waited as long as I dared to make sure the spiders were really gone,
and then I started off in the direction of the campsite.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Ranta's
Gift of Running meant she could run further and faster than most
people, and as far as I knew, spiders weren't famous for running, so
she should be able to shake them off and circle around to start
moving towards the campsite. I had to do my best to make sure she
didn't have to worry about me at all.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I
walked, ran, walked, ran, stopped and breathed, walked and ran, for
as long as I could before I had to stop and rest for a while. The
dark forest looked pretty much the same no matter where I went, but I
could now see a few stars through the trees, and I made sure they
kept the same shape in the sky as I moved.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I
stopped to rest in a clearing, sitting down on a log to catch my
breath, when I heard movement in the trees. I got up, preparing to
run, but then a voice called out to me.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Ho,
I am not your enemy!&quot; it said, and I stopped.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Through
the trees came an old man. He was stooped with age, and covered with
ragged robes, leaning on a wooden stick and pulling himself along
like a strange three-legged creature. His hair and beard were long
and white;  I couldn't see his face, as it was hidden behind a wooden
mask, which I could see was fastened to his head with leather straps.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	This
must be a hermit, I decided. I had read about them in books; most of
them were old men who lived out in the desert or the forest by
themselves. The townspeople usually called them crazy, but hermits
often knew many things, and would offer their wisdom to the hero. </FONT></FONT>

the bottled water good?&quot; the hermit asked.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Wh-what
bottled water?&quot; I asked in response.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	The
hermit pulled himself up to me, leaning on his stick, and sniffed the
air. &quot;The bottled water is good!&quot; he declared. &quot;Come,
come with me to my cabin. I'll give you food and a soft bed.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Can
you help me find the campsite?&quot; I asked.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	
&quot;Campsite?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Ranta
had the map, so I couldn't show him, but I pointed east and said,
&quot;The campsite that way. People go there to sleep in tents.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Yes,
yes, I'll help you get back. Come with me!&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Sometimes
hermits were dangerous, but on the whole he seemed less dangerous
than the giant spiders, and he said he could get me back to the
campsite, so I decided to go with him. That turned out to be a bad
idea, but I didn't know that at the time.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	As
I followed him to the cabin, I hoped that Ranta had managed to throw
off the spiders and was coming back around to where I was.</FONT></FONT></P>
