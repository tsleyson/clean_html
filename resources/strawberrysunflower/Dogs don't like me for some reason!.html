<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Dogs
don't like me for some reason! By Nora.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	After
the time when Cora almost got us all stung to death by hornets
because she tried to cheat in a soccer match with Ranta, Lily invited
Ranta to join our club, but Ranta turned us down. She said she
couldn't join full time, but we could ask her if we ever needed an
extra pair of hands for anything.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Soon
after that, when I was helping Lily out in the garden, I asked her
why she had agreed to help Ms. Rutherford clear out the PE shed. &quot;Um,
I'm not complaining,&quot; I said. &quot;I still want to be in the
club with you. It's just, I thought...I thought we were going to be
doing things that were a little bigger.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Lily
smiled. &quot;I didn't start this club to do small jobs like that,
but to do bigger jobs, we first have to show everyone they can trust
us with small jobs. That's why I agreed to help Ms. Rutherford.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;But
Cora might quit.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;That's
up to her. We could use her help, but if she doesn't want to do jobs
like that, she doesn't have to be a member. And you, Nora: you don't
have to push yourself for my sake.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I
shook my head. &quot;No, I'm all right. I don't mind doing whatever I
can to help, since I don't have any gift yet.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Even
though Lily said I didn't have to push myself for her sake, she was
so nice that it made me want to push myself for her sake. That's why
I did what I did a few days after that when I was in the clubroom
alone.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Lily
is always in the garden after school, and she loses track of time
when she's in the garden, so it usually takes her a while to get to
the club. On the rare days that she attends her classes, she has to
walk over from the middle school building. Cora doesn't always come,
but when she does, she usually has to say goodbye to all her friends
in class (which is most of the class) and then pack up all her things
and drop them off in her room, change her clothes, and come over. I
bring my school supplies to the clubroom with me and don't change my
clothes, so I'm always here first.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	When
no one else is here, I like to take the book I'm reading and climb
into the window seat and bask in the sunlight, like a lizard, while I
read. Today I was reading &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;, by Edmund
Spencer, which Ranta had recommended to me. It was really good so
far, although Spencer used a lot of weird spellings.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I
let the sun and the words both envelop me, taking me away from the
place I was. I was so entranced that I didn't notice right away when
the door opened. Once I did notice, I thought that Lily or Cora had
come, but when I looked up, I didn't recognize the silhouette through
the curtains. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Hello?
Anyone here?&quot; a voice called. &quot;Come out, those curtains
aren't hiding you.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I
opened the curtains and saw the speaker was a girl about my age,
though she was tall and looked mature, like Ranta. The white band
pinned to the arm of her blouse told me she was a member of the
student council.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Are
you a member of Lily's Helping Hands?&quot; the girl asked.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I
had had no idea that was the name of our club, but I nodded.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Can
you speak?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I
nodded, unsure why she would ask me that.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Will
you say something right now?&quot; she asked, talking very slowly and
loudly.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Um,
what sort of thing do you want me to say?&quot; I asked.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;That's
good enough. Now, my name is Jane and I'm the Student Council General
Affairs officer. I've come to ask this club for help. They tell me
that's what this club does.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Yes,
we help people in need. What do you need help with?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Come
with me.&quot; Jane took me by the arm and marched me out the door,
down towards the grounds.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	The
elementary school building was actually a complex of three buildings,
connected by a large courtyard with roofed paths to keep the rain off
when it was wet outside. The main building housed the dining hall,
kitchens, classrooms, and offices, including the lounge that Lily had
made into our clubroom. The dormitory building held the rooms for
both the students and the teachers, who lived on the top floor, and
also the laundry room and the common rooms, where we could watch
television, study, read, or chat. The library building held the
elementary school library and also the shop, where we could buy
school supplies and snacks.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	The
courtyard had all sorts of little nooks and crannies where animals
and homesick kids could hide. I'm proud to say that I was never
homesick enough to hide from the teachers in the courtyard, but some
kids were, and I could understand why. A stray dog had made itself a
home in the alley behind the kitchens, and the student council was
afraid that it might attack someone if they left it there, so they
had passed a motion to have the dog removed. As general affairs
officer, it fell to Jane to figure out exactly how to remove it, and
she had turned to Lily's club to get it done. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Um,
I'll try,&quot; I said as Jane brought me to where the dog was, &quot;but
dogs don't like me very much, so...&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;That
won't be a problem. We used student council funds to buy this collar,
muzzle, and leash,&quot; said Jane, taking them out of her satchel
and giving them to me. &quot;Put them on the dog and lead him out.
Then get him outside the gates and lock him out. That should be good
enough. We'll suggest building a fence across the alley to the
teachers at the next general meeting.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I
took the collar, muzzle, and leash. They were red nylon and didn't
look like anything special. I didn't think I'd be able to get them on
the dog, but I decided to try, for Lily's sake. If I could do a small
job like this, it would prove to the people that our club was ready
to take on big jobs.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Here
we are,&quot; said Jane. &quot;This is where I leave you. I'll be
waiting at the gates to shut them behind the dog.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Now
that I was here, it was kind of scary. The alley behind the kitchen
was dark, even though the sun was high in the sky, and it was big,
too. I was sure the dog had chosen to live here because of all the
nice food scraps, and he might be mad at me for trying to take him
away from there. Still, I had to do my best.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I
sidled up to the mouth of the alley, and then I heard a low growling
noise from the darkness. It sounded like the growling of a big, angry
bear protecting its cubs. My heart started beating faster, and I
backed away from the mouth of the alley.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I
knew that I needed to finish this job for Lily's sake, and so I
worked up my courage and tiptoed up to the mouth of the alley again.
The growling started again, and once again I backed away.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	The
only way I was ever going to get past the mouth of that alley, I
decided, was if I just charged in. So I took a few deep breaths,
worked up my courage again, and ran for the mouth of the alley.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Suddenly
the dog started barking, a deep, rough, scary bark like a huge
mastiff, and I skidded to a stop and turned around and ran away from
the mouth of the alley.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;What
are you doing?&quot; Cora asked as she came up. She must have been on
the way from her room to the clubroom; she had changed out of her
jeans and T-shirt into her nice skirt and blouse, her tail swishing
around under the pleats.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Oh,
Cora. I'm trying to get this leash on that dog,&quot; I said,
pointing into the alley.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Why?&quot;<BR>	&quot;The
student council asked me to, as a member of the club. But, for some
reason, dogs have never liked me. They growl and bark at me whenever
I come up to them.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Maybe
they can sense that you're filled with yummy cream, and they'd like
to chomp you open and lick it out,&quot; said Cora. She took the
leash and walked into the alley. I couldn't see what was happening,
but I could hear whining and licking, and the next second Cora came
out of the alley with a Basset hound on a leash.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;He's
nothing,&quot; said Cora, petting the dog's head and jiggling his
long, wrinkly face. &quot;Just a big softie.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	That's
what she said, but when that dog saw me, he started growling again,
and baring his teeth at me, until I backed away. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Um,
do you like dogs?&quot; I asked.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;No,
I hate them. Obviously. I'm a cat.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	The
dog obviously didn't feel the same way. He followed Cora obediently
as she began to lead him towards the gates. I went after them at a
distance of about ten feet, which was how far away I had to be so the
dog wouldn't growl and snarl.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	We
came to the gates of the elementary school and found Jane waiting for
us, and Lily. &quot;So this is the dog who's been chasing off the
people who sneak snacks in between meals,&quot; said Lily. &quot;He
looks like someone's well-fed pet. I wonder if anyone owns him.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Either
way, he was making a nuisance of himself, so he had to be removed,&quot;
said Jane. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;He's
pretty tame, except when Nora's around,&quot; said Cora. &quot;He
hates her.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	We
put the dog outside the gates, and Jane shut them. He sat outside,
staring at us through the gates with his long, sad face as we left. I
felt a little bit bad about leaving him outside like that when it was
going to get dark soon, with nothing to eat and nowhere to go, but he
was a dog, so I guessed he would make it somehow.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Very
good work. I'll make sure the student council comes to you with any
future tasks we need assistance with,&quot; said Jane, shaking
everyone's hand before she left.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I'm
sorry I wasn't able to finish the job,&quot; I said, mostly to Lily,
although also to Cora who had come in and helped me.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;None
of us can do everything on her own,&quot; said Lily. &quot;That's why
we all work together. Each of us has a unique gift, and when one of
us can't finish a job, it's all right to ask someone else who can.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Yeah,
except Nora will need help on every job,&quot; said Cora.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I
know one job that Nora can complete all on her own,&quot; said Lily.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Oh
yeah?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Yes,
it's a very difficult job, but I know she can do it.&quot; Lily
turned to me, a serious look on her face. &quot;Nora.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Yes!&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Anyone
who fails all the tests isn't allowed to be in a club until managing
to pass the next round of tests. So I'm giving you a job. You have to
make sure that Cora and Ranta study so that they don't fail their
next set of tests and get barred from helping the club.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Y-yes!&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I
saw Cora scowling and cleaning her glasses on her shirt. Ranta was
one thing, but making sure Cora didn't fail was going to be a
challenge.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	By
the way, we found out later that one of the teachers at the middle
school had taken the dog in as a pet, so things ended happily for
him. I was glad to hear that; even though he didn't like me, he was
so nice to Cora that he must have been a good dog at heart. In that
way, he was a lot like Cora, who didn't like me, but was so nice to
Lily that I knew she must be a good kitty at heart. Maybe that's why
the dog came to her.</FONT></FONT></P>
