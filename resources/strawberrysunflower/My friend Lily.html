<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=4><B>My
friend Lily. By Nora.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Even
though I still didn't have any friends in class, everything seemed
better now that I had Lily. When I had to work on a group assignment
and the rest of the group was ignoring me and talking, I would do the
assignment on my own and imagine what Lily would think about it.
Talking to people in class seemed easier, because I wasn't so worried
about saying the wrong thing and ruining my chance to make a friend.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	After
class, I would go over to the garden and rub the scent of martagon
lilies on my hands and part the hedge, and go through to Lily's
secret corner of the garden, and we would talk while I helped her
take care of the plants. They needed a lot of things, like water,
special soil, and different amounts of sunlight. Some of them also
needed trimming and pruning. Lily took care of all of them, and she
seemed to always know exactly what each plant wanted, as if she could
talk to them.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	One
day I was watering a patch of roses when I saw a purple flower that I
recognized as a milk thistle growing underneath a rose plant. I was
about to pull it out, but Lily stopped me.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Don't
pull it out,&quot; she said.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;But
milk thistles are weeds. They overgrow everything else,&quot; I said.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;They
may be selfish, but as long as we make sure they share, we can still
let them live here,&quot; said Lily, taking her garden trowel from
the pocket of her overalls. She slid it down into the soil and pulled
up the milk thistle, leaving all of its roots intact inside a clump
of dirt. &quot;Let's go find somewhere we can let this little one
grow.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	We
settled on a space near the blackberry bushes with lots of sunlight.
&quot;The blackberries are selfish too,&quot; said Lily, &quot;so
they'll help keep him in line. And some day he might thank us for
letting him live here. You know, milk thistle can be used to make
medicine that can help cure liver disease and poison mushroom. So
even though some people call them weeds, they also have a gift that
only they can give us.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;You
always seem to know exactly what to do when it comes to plants,&quot;
I said.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;It's
my gift. I have the Gift of Gardening.&quot; Lily took some
strawberries from her satchel and offered them to me. They were from
the strawberry sunflower, and were some of the ripest and sweetest
I'd ever tasted. &quot;Though it might be better to say I have the
gift of understanding what plants are telling me.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Do
they talk?&quot; I asked.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;They
don't talk or make any noises, but they do have feelings. They're not
like human feelings or animal feelings, though. Plant feelings are
slow, strong, twisting. A person might be mad for a few minutes, but
a plant builds up its feelings gradually over a long time, and then
keeps feeling that way for a long time.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I
didn't totally understand, but I thought it was amazing, and I told
Lily so.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;It's
not that amazing.&quot; Lily looked embarrassed to be complimented
like that. &quot;I may be able to understand plants, but it means I
have a hard time understanding people.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	We
finished taking care of the plants, and as we were leaving the
garden, Lily said, &quot;I told you about my gift, but I never asked
what your gift is.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Oh.
Um, my gift, er...I don't know yet.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Oh,
you're a Potential.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Yes.
It's kind of embarrassing...&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Lily
shook her head. &quot;There's nothing wrong with being a Potential.
It's kind of fun that way, wondering what gift you'll get, looking
forward to the wonderful things you'll be able to do someday. It's
like waiting for Christmas.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Some
of the kids with gifts looked down on Potentials, who didn't have
gifts yet, but what Lily said made me feel good about it. Even though
she had such an amazing gift, she wasn't snobby at all.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Lily
was in middle school, so her dormitory and dining hall were in a
different building across the field from the elementary school, but
she seemed to spend a lot of time in the elementary school building,
even though middle schoolers weren't supposed to come over here. It
seemed like Miss Hanover had given her permission to come over
whenever she wanted to. I would often come to breakfast or dinner and
find her in the dining hall, waiting for me. We would go through the
line and get our food, then choose a small table in one of the
corners, away from all the hustle and bustle of the walkway. Once the
head chef himself came out to talk to Lily at our table.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Lily,
thanks for all these beautiful vegetables you grow for us,&quot; he
said, as I hid behind my bangs.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Thank
you for making them into such nice food,&quot; said Lily. &quot;I'm
sure they're happy to be cooked by someone as skilled as you.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;No,
no. Good food comes from the ingredients. Without ingredients, a chef
is nothing.&quot; The head chef then turned his gaze on me. &quot;Is
this your friend?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Yeah,
this is my friend Nora,&quot; said Lily. &quot;She's been helping me
out in the garden.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Thanks
for your good work, Nora,&quot; said the head chef.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Um,
y-you're welcome...&quot; I stammered.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I'd
better get back to the kitchen. Thanks again,&quot; said the head
chef.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	When
Lily and I had finished eating, Lily said, &quot;I guess I should go
check my mail.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;The
mail doesn't come to your room?&quot; I asked.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;No,
my club mailbox. I've been neglecting the club for a while now.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	
&quot;Oh you're in a club? And they make you check the mail?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Lily
smiled. &quot;Well, I am the club president&mdash;and only member&mdash;so
pretty much everything is my duty.&quot; She stood up. &quot;Come on,
let's go the clubroom, and I'll show you.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I
followed Lily up the stairs to the third floor, where there were lots
of empty offices and lounges. The elementary school building had lots
of empty rooms, because we didn't have as many teachers, tutors, and
coaches as the other schools. Elementary school students weren't
allowed to start their own clubs, although the teachers had started
lots of clubs that we were allowed to join, like the literature club,
the music club, and the natural sciences club. Elementary school
students could also join high school clubs if we could find a high
school student to sponsor us and get permission from the club's
adviser and our teacher.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=4><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">	I
had thought about joining a club as my next move to make friends, so
I had read all </SPAN></FONT><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">about
them in the handbook.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Lily
took us down the hall to the wooden door of a lounge. A manila
envelope hung on the wall next to the door, pinned up with a
thumbtack. &quot;This is my mailbox,&quot; she said, looking inside.
&quot;Still nothing. Looks like no one needs help today.&quot; She
took a key from the pocket of her overalls and unlocked the door.
&quot;Come inside, and we'll have some tea.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	
Inside, the room was similar to the teacher's lounge, where I had
gone a few times to see Miss Hanover before or after class, but
unlike the noisy and crowded teacher's lounge, decorated with posters
with all sorts of boring grown-up jokes on them, it was still and
silent, and Lily had decorated every inch of the wall with plants and
flowers. An arrangement of climbing flower crown vines wound all the
way around the upper parts of the wall, filling the room with a fresh
scent. Off to my left was a little counter with a sink, a teapot, and
some dishes and utensils, also surrounded by flowers. In the center
was a little wooden table with two chairs and a vase of flowers set
atop it. White gossamer curtains swayed over a pair of tall bay
windows at the far end of the room. The teacher's lounge had the same
window seats, and I had always wanted to go sit on them and absorb
the sunlight while reading. I didn't have a book with me now, but I
still took my chance to go sit on them and absorb the sunlight while
Lily made tea.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Do
you like milk and sugar in your tea, Nora?&quot; Lily asked.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;No,
thank you. Plain for me, please,&quot; I said as I climbed into the
window seat. From here you could see across the campus, all the way
to the high school building and beyond to the mountains. The high
school soccer team was practicing on the field, moving around like
tiny ants in the distance, chasing a ball I couldn't see.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	When
the tea was done, I went to climb down from the window seat, but Lily
said, &quot;You can stay there if you like&quot; with a smile, so I
took my cup and saucer up into the window with me and drank tea while
looking out across the school.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;It's
too bad we can't see the garden from here,&quot; I said. &quot;I bet
it would look amazing from this height.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	When
my tea was gone, I came down from the window seat and washed my cup
and saucer in the sink and put them out to dry on the dish towel. &quot;So
what do you do in this club?&quot; I asked.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;It's
the tea-drinking club,&quot; said Lily.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Eh?
They allow clubs like that?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Only
joking. I actually made this club to gather together people with all
sorts of gifts, and pair them up with someone who needs their help.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I...don't
understand,&quot; I admitted.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=4><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">	&quot;Well,
everyone in this school has a gift, even if they don't know what it
is yet. And somewhere out there, maybe there's a person who needs
help from someone with that gift. Maybe someone out there is having
trouble growing food that they need to feed their family. Then I
might be able to help them with my Gift of Gardening. Or maybe
someone is sick and isn't getting better. Then one of my friends from
the high school might be able to help them with his Gift of
Strengthening. We all have gifts, and even though some of them might
seem </SPAN></FONT><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">useless,
they can all be useful to the right person.&quot;</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Like
the milk thistle,&quot; I suggested. &quot;Even though it might be a
weed to someone trying to grow roses, it could be medicine to someone
with mushroom poisoning.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Lily
smiled. Her smile was so beautiful and gentle that I always felt a
tingle in my back when I saw it, and it made me feel like smiling
too. &quot;Exactly,&quot; she said. &quot;So, do you want to join?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Me?
But I don't have any gift yet.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;That's
not true,&quot; said Lily. &quot;Even if you don't have any power
like my Gift of Gardening yet, you still have gifts that only you can
offer to someone in need.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Just
as I was about to respond, the door opened. Standing there, with a
slight blush on her face, a cake box in her hand, her cat ears
standing straight up, her orange-and-white pigtails decorated with
yellow ribbons and her glasses fogged up around the corners, was
Cora.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	She
began to smile at Lily, but then caught sight of me and looked
disappointed.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Hiding
behind my bangs suddenly wasn't good enough, so I quickly got up and
pulled the curtains in front of me, and shut my eyes tight.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I
can still see you, idiot,&quot; Cora said. I heard her set the cake
box on the table and I opened my eyes. These curtains really were
easy to see through. Nonetheless, I stayed behind them, pulling them
closer around me to hide my feet.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Hi,
Cora,&quot; said Lily. &quot;What brings you here?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Cora's
tone of voice became completely different as she said, &quot;I
brought this cake for you! I was hoping we could, um, maybe eat it
together.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Lily
opened the box and looked inside. &quot;That looks delicious.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Doesn't
it?&quot; Cora agreed.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;And
there should be enough here for Nora to have some.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Ye...yeah,
I guess so...&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;But
we only have two chairs. Let me go look in some of the other rooms
and see if I can find another one,&quot; said Lily, getting up from
the table. &quot;Nora, won't you help Cora make tea and cut the
cake?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Um,
s-sure,&quot; I stuttered. I poked my face out from the curtains and
saw Cora getting a knife and beginning to cut the cake, looking
annoyed all the while. When she had left the counter with a knife, I
went over there and began to make tea.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Lily
had a self-heating teapot, so we didn't need to have a stove in the
room to heat water. All I had to do was fill the teapot with water,
put it on the heat-absorbing tile, and twist the little red ball at
the top, and the teapot would heat the water inside. I started the
water heating, then turned around to see Cora glaring at me and
jumped.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Let's
be clear about this,&quot; said Cora. &quot;I'm only sharing this
with you because of Lily. Otherwise I wouldn't give you any.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I
reached for the nearest curtains and hid behind them again. &quot;O-of
course, I know that. Y-you told me you didn't want to be
f-f-f-friends with me and I g-got the message...&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=4><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">	&quot;Well,
as long as you understand, that's okay. But I guess it's not that bad
that you're </SPAN></FONT><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">here.
It gives me the chance to apologize.&quot;</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Huh?&quot;
I was confused, and peeked out from behind the curtains to see Cora
polishing her glasses on her shirt, looking away from me as if she
were embarrassed.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I'm
sorry about what I said the other day. I still don't want to be
friends with you, but the stuff I said was too mean. Sorry.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I
came out from behind the curtains and stepped closer to Cora.
&quot;I...accept your apology. I guess it was a little too forward of
me to just come up and ask you to be my friend like that.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;That's
right! I had no idea what to say when you just popped off like that,
so my true feelings just came out,&quot; said Cora. &quot;But saying
all that was too mean, and I felt bad afterward. So I apologize.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I
somehow felt like she was still insulting me, but I appreciated the
intentions behind what she was saying. &quot;I thought maybe you were
mad at me about the soccer game,&quot; I said.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;That
was obviously an accident! Everyone just got too worked up. At least
you were trying. Some girls hate sports so much they just stand in
the middle of the field like lawn gnomes, and that's the kind of girl
that really makes me mad. Besides, I win so much at sports that
losing one stupid PE soccer game is nothing to me. I don't give a
rat's tail about that.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Hearing
that made me think that Cora really was a nice person after all, so I
made tea for the three of us and sat down to talk with her while we
waited for Lily to come back. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Um,
how did you become friends with Lily?&quot; I asked.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Cora
put her glasses back on and started playing with her own tail,
holding it and swirling the tip around her finger. &quot;We met two
years ago, when Lily was still here in the elementary school,&quot;
she said. &quot;My teacher back then, Mr. Grayson, was making us just
read and read and read. He had us sit there at our desks for two
hours, just reading this stupid book he loved. You probably know what
it is&mdash;U something, by some Irish guy.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Even
though I had read a lot of books, I wasn't a library database, so I
couldn't figure out what book it was from such a vague description. I
shook my head, and Cora went on.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Anyway,
after two hours Mr. Grayson told us if we couldn't reach page fifteen
by lunchtime, we'd have to sit there in the classroom through lunch
until we got there. I was already starting to get hungry, and my head
hurt from all that reading, and my legs were itching to get outside
and run. When he said that, it made me mad, so I threw the book at
the window and ran out of the classroom.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	After
an incident like that, it was amazing that Cora hadn't been labeled
an angry, violent person and left out of the class like me.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;After
I ran around the grounds a little bit, I worked out all my anger and
was starting to think that I should go back to the classroom and
apologize, but I was afraid that Mr. Grayson would be mad at me and
I'd get in trouble. As I was walking around wondering what to do,
Lily found me.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=4><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">	&quot;I
asked her why she wasn't in class and she said she had permission
from her teacher to come to the garden during certain activities. She
asked me why I wasn't in class, and I told her what had happened.
Lily said when people get mad at someone, they'll first be angry
</SPAN></FONT><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">about
whatever happened to make them mad, then they'll stop being mad after
they have time to cool off. But if the person they're mad at doesn't
apologize, then after a while they'll get mad at that person again
for not apologizing. She said Mr. Grayson had probably just stopped
being mad, and she would come with me to apologize to him before he
got mad at me again for not apologizing.&quot;</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Lily
walked me back to class and went with me to apologize to Mr. Grayson.
I told him I was sorry and I would take any punishment he wanted to
give me for what I did. But Mr. Grayson admitted that he might have
been unreasonable, and he said we could all go to lunch and he'd give
us some time the next day to read up to page fifteen.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;After
I saw how amazing Lily is, I wanted to be her friend, but I somehow
get embarrassed and can't be myself when she's around, so we never
managed to get close.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Don't
worry,&quot; I said. &quot;I'm sure Lily wants to be friends with you
too. After all, you told her all about getting angry and throwing the
book at the window, so she knows that you're a violent and brutal
person, yet she hasn't abandoned you.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;You
little--!&quot; Cora snarled, and I jumped up and hid behind the
curtains again.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Are
you two getting along well?&quot; Lily asked as she came in carrying
a chair, followed by Miss Hanover, also carrying a chair.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Miss
Hanover? What are you doing here?&quot; asked Cora.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Hello
Cora, Nora. I'm this club's faculty adviser,&quot; said Miss Hanover.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I
asked her where I could find a chair,&quot; said Lily, &quot;and when
she heard there was cake, she insisted on coming to advise the club.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I
left the sanctuary of the curtains and made a cup of tea for Miss
Hanover too, and we sat down to have cake together.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;By
the way, Cora, were you able to finish that book in the extra time
that Mr. Grayson gave you?&quot; I asked.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;No.
I think I gave up the twenty-third time I had to read page two, and
just started drawing in the margins.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=4><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">	&quot;Are
you talking about </SPAN></FONT><FONT SIZE=3><I><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">Ulysses</SPAN></I></FONT><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">,
by James Joyce?&quot; Miss Hanover asked.</SPAN></SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Yes.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Miss Hanover and Lily
exchanged knowing looks. &quot;Do you want to tell her, Lily?&quot;
Miss Hanover said.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;It was your
idea,&quot; said Lily.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Miss Hanover took a
sip of tea and said, &quot;Cora, after Lily told me how the two of
you met, I started to ask Mr. Grayson some questions about the book
he was having his class read. After a while I could tell that he had
no idea at all what the book was about. I told him I didn't think it
was right to make his fourth-grade class read a book that many
adults, including him, can't understand.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;So he stopped
making his class read that book?&quot; Cora asked.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=4><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">	&quot;No.
He said if his fourth-grade teacher had made him read it, then today
he'd be able to understand it just fine. But since he had no idea
what the book was about anyway, I waited a few days and then showed
him an order form saying that he'd ordered the wrong book. So </SPAN></SPAN></FONT><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">he
reordered everything, and nowadays his class reads </SPAN></SPAN></FONT><FONT SIZE=3><I><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">The
Adventures of Odysseus </SPAN></I></FONT><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">and
they can all reach page fifteen by lunch.&quot;</SPAN></SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Cora's face lit up,
and she stood up and threw her arms around Miss Hanover, quickly
letting go again. Then she took Lily's and Miss Hanover's plates and
served them the two extra pieces of cake we'd ended up with when we
cut it.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Somehow, this
gives me a nice warm feeling inside,&quot; I said</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Miss Hanover and Lily
smiled, but Cora scowled and started cleaning her glasses. &quot;That's
just your twice-baked brain,&quot; she said.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Her glasses get dirty
a lot.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	By the way, later,
after Miss Hanover left, I told Lily I would love to join her club.
Cora chimed in and said she would too, so Lily's club got two new
members. I'm not sure what gift I can offer to help others, but I'll
do whatever I can.</FONT></FONT></P>
