<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Math
is hard! By Nora.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Tests
were coming up in the elementary school, so all the clubs were put on
suspension while everyone studied.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Since
Lily was a middle school student, her club wasn't stopped by the
elementary school. But Lily told us that if any jobs came up, she
would handle them herself so Cora, Ranta, and I had time to study. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Since
Lily had given me the job of making sure that Cora and Ranta didn't
fail all the tests, I asked them if they would meet me in the
clubroom every day after class to study. Ranta agreed, but Cora
didn't want to at first.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I
don't need your help,&quot; she insisted when I asked her after class
one day. &quot;I'll do better studying on my own.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Ranta
is studying with me,&quot; I said. &quot;She might do better than you
on the test. And Lily's going to be in the clubroom while we're
studying. She'll see you working hard so you can keep doing club
activities with her, and it'll make her think good things about you.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Cora's
cat ears flattened down against her head. &quot;Fine, I'll come join
your group.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	It's
surprisingly easy to get Cora to do what you want, once you know the
right things to say.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	The
three of us studied reading, writing, spelling, grammar, history, and
science together. Ranta was good at reading, but she was terrible at
spelling, and whenever she wrote anything she would spend so much
time fixing her spelling that she forgot what she was going to write.
Since she was good at reading, she was also pretty good at history,
and she wasn't too bad at grammar or science either. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I
just get bored when I have to sit still for too long and read big,
boring books,&quot; she admitted, &quot;so when I try to study by
myself, I always end up reading a story or going out for a run.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Why
don't you try going for a run before you start studying?&quot; Lily
suggested as she served us tea and sliced melon. Lily was so nice,
she had been making tea and snacks for us every day while we studied.
She would sometimes stay in the room with us after that, but more
often she would go down to the garden for a while and come back with
fruit and nuts for us. She also grew herbs for her own herbal teas,
like the peppy mint tea she'd given me the first time we met. Her
concentration chamomile was an amazing help for studying; it let me
keep my focus for a long time, even if I was studying something
boring.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I'd
like to go for a run before, during, and after studying,&quot; said
Cora, who was tapping a pencil on the table and glowering at the same
page of grammar exercises she'd been working on for the past two
days. Nothing seemed to help her. She would do all the questions
wrong and then get mad at me whenever I tried to explain her
mistakes, so there wasn't a lot I could do to help her. The
concentration chamomile hadn't helped her, either; since she didn't
know how to do any of the work, it didn't matter how good her
concentration was, I guessed.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;How
long have you been working on those problems? All week?&quot; Ranta
asked. &quot;Look, Cora, it's really quite simple. This is the
subject. This is the verb. The verb is the action word. Just go
through and circle the verbs and subjects.&quot;<BR>	&quot;Shut up!&quot;
Cora snapped. &quot;I know that. I just don't want to do it. And you
didn't know that either until Nora explained it to you.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Nora
tried to explain it to you, but you yelled at her and made her hide
behind the curtains,&quot; said Ranta.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Please
don't fight,&quot; I begged them.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;By
the way,&quot; said Lily, &quot;I've seen you studying lots of
things, but so far I haven't seen you study any math.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	My
blood ran cold at that word. I could tell by the looks on Ranta's and
Cora's faces that it was the same for them.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Are
you all really confident about math?&quot; Lily asked. &quot;That's
great, I was always so bad at it.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;No,
no, it's not that we're confident,&quot; said Ranta.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;It's
more like we're too afraid to even try,&quot; said Cora.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	For
once, they agreed.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;What
about you, Nora?&quot; Lily asked. &quot;Can you help them a bit with
their math?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I
shook my head.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Are
you also not very good at math?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I
stood up, pushed in my chair, and ran straight for the curtains.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	When
I see words, I read them, and they make sense to me.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	When
I see numbers, they swirl around in my head and chase each other like
a pack of angry wolves. My big sister says I'm a number fumbler.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	It's
always been like that, but it got even worse when I moved up and
started doing fractions and decimals. Now, instead of each problem
having two numbers, it has four numbers, or six numbers, or ten
numbers, or a million numbers, or a zillion numbers, or...</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Ah,
my head is spinning.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Whenever
Miss Hanover starts talking about math, I usually hide behind my
bangs so she doesn't notice me and I don't get called on to give the
answer. So far it's worked; I've never been called on to give an
answer in class. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Well,
when it comes to math, I've always found the only way is to work lots
and lots of problems so you can remember how to do it long enough to
get through the test, then forget it all,&quot; said Lily. &quot;Let
me go gather more concentration chamomile. You'll need it.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Cora
continued to struggle with the grammar problems while Ranta and I
started on some math exercises. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Fractions
are my weakness, so I guess we should work on those first,&quot; I
said.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Okay.
What's one fourth plus one fifth?&quot; said Ranta.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I
wrote the two fractions down on my paper, separated by a plus sign,
and stared at them. I was at a loss. If only there were words instead
of these numbers. I tried writing it out as words--'one fourth plus
one fifth equals'--but that didn't help anything. I stared some more.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I
can't remember,&quot; I admitted.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Ranta
starting helping me, and we came up with the answer two twentieths,
which looked wrong to me. Miss Hanover had shown us how fractions
could represent pieces of pie, and how we could check the answer on
problems like this by drawing three pies and splitting one pie into
four pieces, one into five pieces, and one into twenty pieces. If one
piece of the first pie and one piece of the second pie put together
looked as big as one piece of the third pie, the answer was right. I
did that, and saw that the pieces from the first two pies were
definitely bigger than one piece of the third pie. I told Ranta I
didn't think the answer was right.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;You're
right,&quot; said Ranta, scratching her head. &quot;Geez! This is why
I hate math.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;You
were wrong when you multiplied them,&quot; said Cora. &quot;Look, if
you multiply both desalinators by zero, you get one zeroth plus one
zeroth, which is two zeroths.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I
know for sure that's wrong,&quot; said Ranta. &quot;There's no such
thing as one zeroth, and there's definitely no such thing as two
zeroths! And it's the denominator, dumb cat, not the desalinator.
That's something that goes in a water filter.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	We
fought for a while about what part was wrong, getting nowhere, until
Lily came back in with a bag of concentration chamomile. &quot;How's
the math going?&quot; she asked.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Lily!
You've done this before. Show these dolts where they went wrong,&quot;
said Cora.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Lily
came to the table and glanced over my shoulder at the paper, which
was now covered with numbers, plus signs, crossed out numbers and
plus signs, drawings of circles that represented pies, and drawings
of real pies, with whipped cream on top, which I had done while Ranta
and Cora were fighting over whether there is such a thing as one
zeroth. &quot;Oh, fractions,&quot; she said. &quot;I think I'd better
go back out to the garden. There's, um...something I need to do.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Lily
was no help.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Okay,&quot;
said Cora, sounding unexpectedly reasonable. &quot;We're doing this
for Lily so we can keep doing club activities with her. As long as we
don't fail everything, we can keep doing club activities. Right?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Right,&quot;
I said.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;So
here's the plan: just ignore math. We're going to fail it anyway, so
just ignore it. If we can pass at least one subject, we'll be allowed
to keep doing the club, so we just have to make sure there's
something we can pass.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Is
there something you can pass?&quot; Ranta asked.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;No.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Then
let's work on reading,&quot; I said. &quot;That's your worst subject
aside from math, so if you can pass that, Miss Hanover will see that
you've been working hard.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I
thought Cora was going to yell at me like she usually does, but
instead she nodded. &quot;You're right for once, Nora. If I can pass
the reading test, then I can keep doing club activities, and I can
show Ranta that I'm better than her!&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Not
a chance, kitty. Just go back to your litterbox and kick up some
dirt,&quot; said Ranta.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Quit
it with the cat cracks! I'll scratch you!&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Now,
now, please don't fight,&quot; I said, trying to calm them down.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I
thought that after a while, Cora would get mad and start yelling at
me like before, but she actually seemed to have gotten fired up to do
well in reading, because she sat quietly and read the passage, then
worked on the questions, asking me if something confused her. By the
end I felt like she really understood the passage and knew why the
answers were the right answers, and it made me feel good to think
that I has been able to help Cora get better at something.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	After
a while, Lily came back, and we promised her that the fractions were
put away. She served us more tea, along with some pear slices and
cashews, and spent the rest of our study time watering the flowers
and plants inside the clubroom.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	We
had our tests the next week. We had a day off on Friday, and Lily,
Ranta, and I went on camping trip, which I'll tell you all about next
time, over the long weekend. On Monday, Miss Hanover had all of our
tests graded, and gave them back to us after class. She left me and
Cora until last, and had us stay so she could talk to us.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Nora,
Cora, the two of you had the lowest scores in the class in math,&quot;
said Miss Hanover, &quot;so I'm going to keep you here and tutor you
for a while to help you learn the material. Cora, you also did poorly
in everything else, so I'll be tutoring you in those areas as well.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	She
gave us our score reports. I had passed everything except for math
with decent grades, but my score in math was horrible. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Trade
you,&quot; said Cora, grabbing my report and handing me hers. It
looked like Cora had failed everything, and her math score was even
worse than mine. Then I noticed that she had actually passed reading.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Miss
Hanover, since Cora passed one subject, she's allowed to do club
activities, right?&quot; I asked.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Yes,&quot;
said Miss Hanover. &quot;Both of you are allowed to do club
activities for now. We'll do this tutoring for a while, and then I'll
give you both another test. If you pass that, we can end the
tutoring. By the way, Cora, I was pleased with your score in reading.
I can see that you worked hard to improve. If we can get your other
scores up too, you'll be doing well.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Yes
Miss Hanover,&quot; said Cora. &quot;Um, the truth is...&quot; She
fidgeted with her tail and glanced around the room. &quot;The truth
is, Nora helped me with reading. That's the only reason I passed it.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I
stared at Cora, shocked to hear her say something nice about me. Miss
Hanover noticed my mouth hanging wide open and smiled.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Then
we'll have Nora help you with your other subjects too, and I'll help
both of you with math,&quot; she said. &quot;I know you can do it.
Nora, you did all the word problems correctly, and those were the
ones that many of the others got wrong, so I see that you can do this
math, but maybe you don't quite realize it yet.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I
don't think so. I must have been lucky,&quot; I said.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;You
weren't. Trust me, after a week or two, you'll be right at the level
of the other children. Both of you.&quot; Miss Hanover smiled. &quot;Let's
get started.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Math
is so hard. It's like one of those riddles: 'When can you know
something, but not know that you know it? When it's the answer to a
math problem.'</FONT></FONT></P>
