<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=4><B>When
will I make a friend? By Nora</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>	</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">How
are you? I'm Nora. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	This
is a story about how I made my first friend at my new school. By the
time I met her, it wasn't really my new school anymore because I had
already been there for two months. But until I finally made a friend,
it didn't feel like my school at all.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	My
school is called St. Galgani's Academy for the Gifted. It's a
boarding school. That means you don't go home after school; I have my
own room in the girl's dormitory where I go sleep every night. I eat
breakfast, lunch, and dinner in the dining hall with the other
elementary school kids.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	St.
Galgani's is a school for kids with special talents, so there are a
lot of amazing people here. Oh, I'm not one of them. Some people from
the academy came to my old school one day and tested everyone to see
if any of us had special gifts. They told me I didn't have any gift,
but I would someday, and asked me to come to the academy. I was
scared when I thought about going away to live by myself at school
without my parents, but my big sister told me to think of it like an
adventure and just throw myself in. My big sister tells me to do lots
of things that aren't good ideas, but she was right for once, so I
came to this academy.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Everything
was scary at first like I thought. The academy was almost as big as
the neighborhood I used to live in with my parents. It had its own
swimming pool, a big garden, a forest, and a horse corral. My old
school would have fit in just the building where my bedroom was. I
was nervous, but also excited to make friends and do lots of
interesting things that I could tell my big sister and the other kids
back home about.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	On
the first day of school my teacher, Miss Hanover, had me come up to
the front and introduce myself to the class. The night before I had
come up with a speech I wanted to say, about making friends and
having fun together for the next year, but when I looked at all those
people sitting in front of me, it all left me. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Go
on, introduce yourself,&quot; said Miss Hanover.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I,
I don't know what...to say,&quot; I whispered.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Miss
Hanover's tail flicked. At the time I thought she was mad at me, but
I later found out that her tail flicks when she's feeling sorry for
someone. Even though she has the Gift of Trickery, she can't ever
play tricks that are too cruel because her tail will flick and give
her away. &quot;Why don't you tell them your name?&quot; she
suggested.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Um,
hi, my name is Nora,&quot; I said, looking over the rows and rows of
desks. I counted them later; there were only twenty of them, four
columns and five rows to a column, but on that day it seemed like
they reached all the way up to the moon. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	One
of the girls in front looked at me, and I looked back, and then
suddenly got nervous and looked down, letting my bangs fall down over
my face to hide it.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Um,
uh, I like reading, and, um...my name is Nora, and...&quot; I tried
to remember my speech. I had written it all down and recited it in my
head three times, but it was all gone now.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;What's
your favorite book?&quot; asked a boy in the second row.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Um...I
like ham...ham and...&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">	I
was trying to say &quot;Hamlet&quot;, but I started stuttering and
couldn't get out the last part, and everyone thought I was saying I
liked ham and laughed. That made me even more nervous, and I could
feel my face getting hot. Besides, </SPAN><I><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">Hamlet
</SPAN></I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">wasn't

were all laughing.</SPAN></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I wanted to run away,
but Miss Hanover put her hand on my shoulder and whispered, &quot;It's
okay, just wait a minute and tell them again.&quot; So I did. When
everyone had stopped laughing, I said it again.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Well, I have,&quot;
said Miss Hanover. &quot;It's a very beautiful book, and Nora is a
very good reader to be able to understand it. Why don't you ask her
about it later? For now, though, let's start class. Nora, you can sit
in that desk there, okay?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Okay,&quot; I
said, my face still burning. I was glad to be done, and I went to my
desk towards the back of the classroom and sat down and buried my
face in my arms so I wouldn't have to look at anyone.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I didn't make things
any better during our first group assignment. It was a week after
class began, and I was assigned to work with Greta and Sweta to
answer some questions about a book we had read. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Greta and Sweta
started talking about a show they had watched on TV last night and
ignoring the assignment and me as soon as we all moved our chairs
into a circle and sat down. I looked over the questions, waiting for
them to be done so we could start answering.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	After five minutes
they still weren't done, so I said, &quot;Um...uh...&quot;.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	They ignored me.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Ex, ex, excuse
me...Um, about the assignment...&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Finally they looked
up, glaring at me like they were annoyed. &quot;What was your name
again? I forget,&quot; said Greta.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;N-Nora,&quot; I

<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I'm talking to
Sweta, so we'll do the assignment later. What are you, some kind of
teacher's pet?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I looked down and hid
behind my bangs, and Greta and Sweta kept talking and went back to
ignoring me. I did the assignment on my own, handed it in to Miss
Hanover, and got to go to lunch early; when I got back everyone was
calling me a teacher's pet.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">	I
had never been a star at sports, but I wasn't that bad. I used to
have fun swimming and playing softball and soccer with my friends at
my old school. So when we had soccer for PE, I thought maybe I could
do something good for my team and show everyone that I wasn't </SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">just
a teacher's pet weirdo who stutters.</SPAN></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	We were playing out on
the third field, a smaller field where the elementary schoolers
usually ended up for PE. St. Galgani's also has a middle school and a
high school, and the high schoolers usually get the bigger first and
second fields. Our teams had been picked by Ms. Rutherford, the
girls' PE teacher. I was on Cora's team, and we were playing against
Leah's team.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Things weren't too bad
at first. I stayed near the back, closer to my team's goal, and
helped move the ball away from our goal and get it back to my
teammates a few times. We were ahead by one goal. Leah's team had the
ball and was moving it back towards our goal, but they were still at
center field. Most of our team was clustered around Leah and Gracie,
who were passing the ball back and forth and moving it down towards
us.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Then I saw that
Mikaela, the strongest player on Leah's team, wasn't standing by the
cluster where the rest of the team was; she was off to the side by
herself. I realized what was going on: Leah was planning to pass the
ball to Mikaela, who was too far away for any of my team to reach in
time. Mikaela would have a clear shot at the goal.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I was the only one who
had noticed. It seemed like my chance had come.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I ran towards Mikaela,
who was still watching the main action and hadn't seen me. I saw Leah
receive the ball from Gracie and then pass it towards us.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I was on Mikaela just
as she received the ball. I went to kick it away from her. </FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Suddenly, my feet slid
out from under me, and I flailed my legs around, trying to keep my
balance. It didn't work, but my foot did hit the ball as I fell
backwards.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	The ball bounced off
my foot and flew up into the air, slamming straight into Mikaela's
nose. Mikaela reacted too late and was hit. I saw her grab onto her
nose.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I found out later that
someone had left a kiwi skin on the field. It was brown and green, so
it blended in with the grass and I couldn't see it. If you've never
eaten one, they're delicious, but at that time I wished there was no
such thing as a kiwi.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Ms. Rutherford stopped
the game and everyone came over to see what was going on. My own
teammates almost stepped on me as they ran over to find out what was
going on.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Are you all
right, Mikaela?&quot; asked Ms. Rutherford.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I think my nose
is bleeding,&quot; Mikaela said.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I'll take her to
the infirmary, Ms. Rutherford,&quot; said Gracie, and the two of them
left the field.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Gracie came back a few
minutes later and we kept playing, but everyone on Leah's team was
mad at me because I took out their best player. As for my own team,
they were mad at me because when we started playing again, Ms.
Rutherford gave Leah's team a penalty kick against us since I had
broken the rules and hit Mikaela with the ball.</FONT></FONT></P>

always nice to me, even though I had almost screamed the first time I
saw her fox ears and asked all sorts of questions about them. It made

feel too good about it.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I decided to be
scientific about searching for a friend. I wanted someone nice and

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">

<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;If you can

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Yes, Miss

like that even when she knew I wasn't sick, I might as well take it.
Plus, a walk in the garden might make me feel better. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I went back into my
room and got dressed in some old jeans and a T-shirt so I wouldn't
get any of my nice clothes dirty in the garden, then took the vase
and left the dormitory headed for the garden.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	The weather outside
was beautiful, and the warm sun felt nice. The garden was pretty far
from the dormitory, on the edge of the forest, and I walked
extra-slow to enjoy the sunshine, so it took me a while to get there.
It was surrounded by a high white fence, one of those ornate wrought
iron fences that are as much art as fence, with the metal twisted
into leaves and vines and flowers. It was fenced in to keep the deer
and rabbits out, not the people; the gate was usually unlocked and
anyone who wanted to could go inside. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I opened the gate and
went in, closing it behind me, and right away I was face-to-face with
a sea of purple, red, yellow, and green. Flowers and plants of all
kinds were in front of me: tulips and daisies and begonias and
orchids. I walked along the winding stone path underneath a lime
tree, and saw a white marble statue of a young boy enclosed in twigs
and bramble, and thought of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem &quot;This
Lime Tree Bower My Prison&quot;. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Now that I was here, I
had no intention of quickly choosing some flowers and trotting back
to the classroom with them. I had to explore this place, at least a
little. As pretty as the flowers here were, I felt as if there must
be much prettier flowers somewhere further inside, and I wanted to
find them. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I'm not sure how much
time I spent wandering the stone paths of that huge, dreamlike
garden, looking at flowers, eating the fruit that grew on the trees,
admiring the creeping vines and ivy and climbing roses that grew up
the trellises, and resting inside the gazebos, staring through their
latticework walls, the light coming down on me in criss-cross
patterns. I spent at least an hour, though it felt much longer.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I came into a clear
and more orderly area where someone had set up raised planter boxes
and was growing potatoes and rutabagas. It seemed to be a dead end;
at the other end was a high hedge that ran all the way down to a
stone wall on both sides. But from the way the garden fence had
looked from the outside, it seemed there should be more to it. It
seemed there should be something past that hedge.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I came up to the hedge
and tried to look through to the other side, but it was so thick that
I couldn't see anything at all. I walked along the hedge from stone
wall to stone wall, trying to find some spot where I could see
through, but there wasn't one.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	As I was making a
second pass along the hedge, I noticed a squirrel creeping along the
bushes ahead of me. The squirrel brushed up against a misplaced clump
of light purple martagon lilies growing in the shade of the hedge.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Suddenly the hedge
parted.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I dashed to where the
squirrel was, but the hole in the hedge had disappeared by the time I
got there, making me wonder if it was just a mirage, some trick of
the light. I watched the squirrel go off on its business. The hole
had appeared exactly when the squirrel had touched those lilies.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I touched the lilies. </FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	The hedge parted
again.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	It was a small hole,
just large enough for me to go through crawling on my hands and
knees. It was a good thing I'd changed into my jeans. I got down and
pulled myself into the tunnel.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	For a brief moment I
was in the dark, surrounded by hedge on all sides. I pulled myself
through, and emerged back into the sunlight on the other side.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I stood up and looked
around. This area of the garden didn't look so different from the
other side, so I wasn't sure why they'd gone to all the trouble of
hiding it, except...</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Nearby was a plant
that looked like a sunflower. Except there was something weird about
it, something that made me look twice. I went up to the sunflower to
get a better look. It truly was a beautiful sunflower, tall and
bright yellow with a crisp green stalk. Except that it didn't have
seeds in the middle like a normal sunflower. It had some kind of huge
red fruit in the middle, something that looked a lot like a
strawberry.	</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I picked one,
wondering if I should eat it. I'd never seen a plant like this
before. I sniffed the fruit. It smelled like a strawberry. I tasted
it. It was a strawberry.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	A sunflower with
strawberries growing in the middle. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I knew then that I had
to find the prettiest flowers from this corner of the garden. This
was definitely where the prettiest flowers would be. Why else would
they hide it behind that hedge?</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	There were no paths
back here except what had been worn in the grass by people walking
through. I followed those worn trails around looking for signs of
flowers. Now that I thought of it, those martagon lilies outside had
been pretty. Maybe there were more of them in here somewhere. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I made my way towards
a patch of tomatoes, their vines wound around wooden stakes in the
ground. Next to them was a small grove of trees with wooden tubes,
pointed down at the tomato patch like the cannons of a pirate ship,
growing from the branches. Martagon lilies like the shade, so there
might be some in the shadow of those trees.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	As I was approaching
the tomato patch, something hard hit me in the chest, bouncing off
and leaving behind a stinging pain. I knelt to see what it was. It
was a walnut.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	WHOOSH!</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Several more walnuts
flew past my head, barely missing my face.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I looked up, and saw
that the trees were shooting walnuts out of those tubes; nuts encased
in a hard brown shell about the size of a golf ball were being
showered on me from above.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	POP!<BR>	The tomatoes
suddenly began to burst, spraying red juice and flesh and seeds all
over me. The explosion of the tomatoes on the first plant seemed to
set off a chain reaction; the explosions rippled through the patch,
moving outward from me. The next instant I was completely soaked with
tomato juice from head to toe, and walnuts were still raining down on
my head.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I turned around and
ran away from that tomato patch as fast as I could, walnuts flying
after me like bullets as I went. I didn't stop running until I was
well out of range of all those dangerous plants, and then I collapsed
on the grass, out of breath.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I hope you won't think
I'm too much of a crybaby if I admit that I cried. After two months
with no friends or family, after what Cora said to me yesterday,
after being attacked by tomato bombs and walnut artillery, I think
you'd cry too, or at least you'd want to.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I sat there in the
middle of the rut worn in the grass and cried for a minute, until a
girl I didn't know appeared on the garden path ahead of me. Then I
got embarrassed and stopped. At least, I tried.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;My, I'm so
sorry! I grew those plants to protect this place from intruders, but
I didn't think about how how it would feel to be attacked by them!&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I stood up and wiped
my eyes, and then thought to check and make sure Miss Hanover's vase
was still okay. It wasn't. The walnuts had hit it and chipped off a
piece of the brim, and I'd dropped it when I collapsed to the ground,
getting dirt and grass all over it.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	The girl I didn't
know&mdash;she looked older than me, possibly a middle school or high
school student--tossed her long blonde braid back over her shoulder
and took a handkerchief from the pocket of her overalls. &quot;Here,
use it to wipe off some of the tomato juice,&quot; she said, giving
it to me.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I took the
handkerchief and wiped my eyes and face with it. I felt bad, because
what was on my face wasn't just tomato juice, but also tears and snot
from crying, so I said, hiding behind my bangs, &quot;I, I, I'll get
it w-washed...for you.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;No worries,&quot;
said the girl. She reached into the leather satchel slung over her
shoulder and took out a Thermos. &quot;Here, drink some of this. It's
tea with peppy mint.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Peppermint?&quot;<BR>	&quot;<I>Peppy</I>
mint. I grow it here. It'll fill you with cheer and vigor and give
you enough energy to do anything! Here, try it.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I took the tea from
her and sipped. It was good. It tasted just like the mint tea that my
mother used to make back home. Each sip seemed to warm up both my
body and my heart. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Are you better?&quot;
the girl asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;A little,&quot;
I said.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Good. I'm sorry
again. If there's anything I can do to make it up to you, just ask.
And don't worry about that handkerchief, just keep it.&quot; The girl
turned to go back to whatever she'd been doing.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Please wait,&quot;
I said, suddenly filled with courage by the peppy mint. &quot;Um,
there is one thing you could do.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;What's that?&quot;
the girl asked, looking back with a smile.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Would you...be

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">

<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Um, I'm Nora.

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Sure did.&quot;

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I agreed. Up until the

time in the garden.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">

<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	By the way, when I
went to apologize to Miss Hanover for breaking her vase and not
getting the flowers, wasn't mad at all. &quot;Someone who used to be
in my class always said the garden was a place to forget all your

about whatever was bothering you.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
