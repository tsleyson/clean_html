<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=4><B>My
rival. By Cora.</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	How
are you? I'm Cora.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	You
probably have a bad image of me because of what that creampuff Nora
said about the first time we met, so let me set the record straight. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	First,
Nora is a teacher's pet, klutz, and creampuff who hides behind Miss
Hanover, the curtains, or whatever else is handy. I can hardly
believe that we're the same age, because she acts like she still
sometimes needs to wear diapers. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Second,
I never hugged Miss Hanover. That didn't happen. I'm not a teacher's
pet creampuff like Nora is, so I wouldn't have done that.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Third,
I really did feel just a little bit like I might have gone too far
when I turned down her friendship in class that time, so I decided to
put up with her even though she's always in the way whenever I try to
become better friends with Lily. Lily is nice to everyone, so when
that creampuff came to her whining about not having any friends, she
graciously agreed to be  friends and entertain that klutz every day
in her clubroom.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	It
made me a little jealous that Nora had accomplished in two minutes
what I'd spent two years trying to do, but I really did feel just a
little bit bad for telling Nora what I did, so I decided to apologize
and put up with her, hoping that I could use her as a stepping stone
to get closer to Lily.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Thanks
to her, I ended up joining Lily's club. I'm not very clear on what
this club does, but if it means I can become better friends with
Lily, then I'm okay with it. If it means being in this club with
Lily, I'm even willing to try and be friends with Nora. I'm even
willing to talk to her in class, if it means that she'll say good
things about me to Lily.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	This
story isn't about Nora, although she does have a part to play in it.
A very small, ignominious part. She screams, hides, flaps, flails,
and wets herself, along with nearly killing me, herself, and the
person I'm about to tell you about. This person is someone who annoys
me even more than Nora.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	That
day, I decided to try talking to Nora in class. I knew this would
either make or break my reputation. Either everyone would decide that
Nora wasn't so bad, and they would all look up to me for being smart
and nice enough to see it, or they would throw me on the creampuff
tray with her and no one in class would ever talk to me again.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I
knew all this, and yet I still went to talk to her before class. I'm
really brave and nice, aren't I? I'm sure you can see that now. Got
it? I'm nothing like the violent, brutal, and mean girl that Nora
probably told you all about.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	When
I came into the classroom that morning, Miss Hanover hadn't arrived
yet, but some of the other kids were there. I went to my desk and set
down my backpack.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Hi
Cora,&quot; said Willow, the girl who sat next to me.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Hi,&quot;
I said.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Did
you finish your homework?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Yeah.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Can
I copy it?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I
let Willow copy it. There was no way that Miss Hanover wouldn't
figure it out. Even without her Gift of Trickery, which let her see
through lies and cheats as well as lie and cheat like a champ
herself, she could have just noted the fact that all my answers were
wrong, and all of Willow's were wrong too, except for the few I had
gotten right, which would also be the few that Willow had gotten
right.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Still,
I'm such a nice person that I let Willow copy. I left her to it and
started moving down the rows of desks towards Nora's desk. We both
sat in the far column, next to the windows, but my desk was closer to
the front than hers.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Having
two sets of ears means I can hear really well, and I can turn my cat
ears to pick up sounds all around me. That's how I knew that Willow
had stopped copying my homework and was whispering with another girl.
They were wondering where I was going. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I
tuned them out and kept going, finally stopping at Nora's desk. Nora
looked up at me with surprise.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Hi,&quot;
I said.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;H-hello...&quot;
Nora replied, her mouth full of marshmallows as usual, and then she
went back to her book.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Something
about this made me really mad, and I wanted to yell at her, but I
reminded myself that she could be my one-way ticket to friendship
with Lily, so I held myself back. The desk next to her was empty, so
I sat down in it and tried to smile. &quot;What are you reading?&quot;
I asked.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Nora
showed me the cover. <I>On the Banks of Plum Creek</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">,
it said, and there was a picture of a river out in a prairie
somewhere, a horse and a plum tree at its edge.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Is it good?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Uh-huh. It's
very interesting.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Good. See you.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Uh-huh.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I stood up and
returned to my own desk. &quot;What was that about?&quot; asked
Willow when I got back.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Nothing.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;She almost
totally ignored you! Are you gonna let that teacher's pet get away
with that? I'm gonna go make sure she understands what her position
is.&quot; Willow got up, but I took her by the arm and shook my head.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Leave her
alone,&quot; I said. &quot;She's a drool-headed creampuff, but she's
not that bad. Just leave her alone.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Willow sat down again,
looking skeptical. &quot;Why'd you go talk to her anyway?&quot; she
asked.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I found out
we're in the same club,&quot; I said, &quot;so I thought we should be
friends.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Looks like she
didn't think so,&quot; said Willow.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	That was true, but I
didn't want to hear it from Willow, who was so dumb she was copying
the dumbest person in class's homework, so I said, &quot;You'd better
finish copying that before Miss Hanover gets here&quot;, and Willow
forgot all about Nora.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I went to the clubroom
after school intending to give that creampuff a piece of my mind. She
knew it, too, because when I came in she was hiding behind the
curtains again, up in the window seat. Lily wasn't here yet&mdash;the
middle school classes let out a bit later than the elementary school
classes, and she had to walk over from the middle school building,
too, so I'd expected to have a few minutes to take care of this
before she came.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Hey! What was
that about this morning?&quot; I asked. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	She didn't say
anything.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I try to talk to
you and you just blow me off?&quot; I pulled the curtains aside.
&quot;Come on, you're not fooling anyone by hi--&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	She was asleep.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Somehow she'd managed
to fall asleep in the five minutes she'd been here before me,
snoozing on the windowsill with drool all over her face and a book on
her stomach. It was the same one from this morning, <I>On the Banks
of Plum Creek</I>.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I picked the book up
and looked at it. &quot;What is so interesting about this garbage? I
don't understand.&quot; I read the back cover. Some garbage about a
pioneer family living on the plains and braving the winter and
mountain lions, or something. As a cat, I was on the mountain lions'
side, so if I read this, I would be hoping for the family to get
eaten the whole time.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	As I was looking at
her garbage, Nora woke up and saw me. As soon as she realized who was
standing over her while she slept, she jumped and tried to hide
behind the curtains.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Hey! What was
the deal with this morning?&quot; I demanded. &quot;I tried to talk
to you, and you just blew me off!&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I...I just
didn't know what to say,&quot; Nora gibbered. &quot;I didn't expect
you to talk to me in class...I thought you'd be worried...about what
the other kids would think...&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;So you thought I
was the sort of person who would just ignore you in class and try to
hide the fact that we know each other? Apologize to me right away!&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I'm sorryyyy!&quot;
Nora squealed like a piglet. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;You don't know
me at all! When I say I'll do something, I do it, and I said I would
talk to you, so I will.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Nora looked at me
stupidly. &quot;What?&quot; I demanded. &quot;Are you going to start
crying?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;No...but...When
did you tell me you'd talk to me, Cora?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I thought back. I
never actually had.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;It was implicit!
Implicit in the talk we had yesterday! You should have been able to
figure it out even without being told directly!&quot; I tossed her
book down on the window seat next to her and went to sit down and
wait for Lily. &quot;I'm not talking to you anymore.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	About ten minutes
later&mdash;ten minutes of sitting in strained silence as Nora read
her book and drooled, or whatever she does while reading&mdash;Lily
came in with Ms. Rutherford, the girls' PE teacher for the elementary
school, in her usual mauve jogging suit.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Ms. Rutherford
is looking for some help clearing one of the PE sheds,&quot; said
Lily. &quot;Since  our club's purpose is to help people, she came to
us for help.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I felt like telling
Ms. Rutherford to go find someone with the Gift of Dust Disappearance
and leave us alone, but I couldn't be so bad-mannered in front of
Lily, so I said, &quot;We can do that, can't we, Nora?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Um, y-yes,&quot;
Nora sputtered as usual.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Just give us a
chance to change out of our school clothes,&quot; I said.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;We'll wait here
for you,&quot; said Lily. &quot;Would you care for some tea, Ms.
Rutherford?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Lily served tea to the
old hag as Nora and I left the room. &quot;Now listen, and don't
forget this,&quot; I said once we were out of earshot. &quot;I am a
nice, kind, generous person. Just like Lily. Right?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Nora looked skeptical,
but she said, &quot;Right.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;So from now on,
talk to me just like you would talk to Lily. That's an order.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Aye-aye, sir...&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	We went off to our
rooms to change. My roommate, Victoria, was lying on the top bunk and
listening to opera on the radio when I came in. I got my gym shorts
and an old, ratty T-shirt and went into the bathroom to change.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Ranta?&quot;
Victoria asked when I came out.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Club,&quot; I
said.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Have a good
time.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	That was what I liked
about Victoria&mdash;she didn't pry into things. What I disliked
about her was her habit of waking up at five in the morning and
singing opera in the shower for forty-five minutes, even on weekends.
She has the Gift of Voice, so she can create some pretty weird sounds
with her voice. She once broke my glasses by singing a high note. My
parents were angry at me, and gave me the lecture about not
appreciating all the hard work they went through to earn their money,
and they didn't believe me when I said my roommate had broken them
with her voice.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I met up with Nora,
who had changed into some grungy old jeans and a T-shirt, and we went
back to the clubroom for Lily and Ms. Rutherford.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Ms. Rutherford led us
down to the shed we would be clearing. It was an old wooden building
by the field, the paint chipping off and the door hinges rusty. Ms.
Rutherford gave Lily the keys.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Please return
them to the faculty office when you're done,&quot; she said. &quot;Be
careful; the shed is infested with hornets. I'd like you to take all
the equipment out and move it to the shed across the way there, and
then we'll call in someone to handle the hornets.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	It seemed to me that
things were going in the wrong order here, but Ms. Rutherford was
gone before anyone could say anything. I knew there was a reason I
never liked that woman.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Lily, who kept bees in
her garden, suggested we set up the hose before we started so we
could spray at the hornets if they attacked us. She also told us to
move slowly and quietly to try not to surprise them. It would be
better, she said, if we could blow some smoke at them to calm them
down before we started, but since we were kids we weren't allowed to
have anything that could make smoke.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I dragged a hose over
from the nearest faucet, turned the water on, and crimped it towards
the end so the water wouldn't keep on running while we were working,
and then Lily unlocked the shed and we got started.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I could hear the
buzzing as soon as the door opened, but I tried to ignore it and tell
myself it was just the cheers of roaring fans as I bravely led the
way into the dark, dusty old shed. Most of the equipment inside was
for soccer. Stood up in the corner was a bundle of the pipes used to
make the goals. The nets were stored in mesh bags next to them. To my
right were two wooden barrels filled with balls. There was also some
general equipment like jerseys and cleats and whistles, and a few
track accessories like starting blocks. It looked like it was going
to take us a while to move all of this, especially since we had to
move slowly to avoid waking up the hornets.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;That old witch
is totally bullying us,&quot; I muttered as I tiptoed towards the
corner to grab the goals and the bag of nets. Lily and Nora followed
me in and started looking around for things to move.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Since Lily worked in
the garden so much, she was pretty strong, so she helped me move the
goals while Nora took the smaller stuff like cleats and whistles. We
decided to just leave everything outside for now so we could move it
all off to the other shed without worrying about the hornets. Once
we'd moved the goals out, Lily took over the smaller equipment while
Nora and I started on the balls. There was no way we could move those
barrels, even with all three of us, so we decided to just carry the
balls out one by one and leave the barrels inside.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	As soon as Nora, that
klutz, lifted a ball off the top of the barrel, a cloud of hornets,
disturbed from their place of rest, came flying up at her face. I
could see her about to scream and ruin everything.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I quickly jumped into
action, grabbing her from behind and clamping my hand over her mouth.
She stopped, and I whispered, &quot;I'm going to back out of this
shed. Just like this. Blink if you understand.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	She blinked, although
I wasn't sure if she really understood or just had dust in her eye. I
started backing out anyway, my left hand over Nora's mouth, my right
hand on her shoulder, guiding her to match my movements. We slowly
backed towards the door, coming out onto the grass without disturbing
the hornets, and I took my hand off of Nora's mouth.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Whew,&quot; Nora
sighed, and she went over and dropped the ball on top of the other
equipment&mdash;and hornets surged out of it.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I couldn't believe
it&mdash;the hornets were living inside the ball.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	There was no time to
think. Nora started screaming and flailing, and I didn't want her to
wake up the other hornets. I grabbed the hose, undid the crimp, and
with my thumb over the end to spread the stream, sprayed all over
Nora and the hornets.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	The hornets didn't
seem to be very bothered by the hose, but I kept spraying them
anyway. They did seem to go out of their way to avoid being sprayed,
so as long as I sprayed around Nora, I could keep them off of her for
a while.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Lily came out of the
shed with a mesh ball bag over her head and another one in her hands.
She ran up to Nora, taking some spray in the process (I tried not to
hit her, but even I can't aim a hose with my thumb over the end very
well), and put the mesh bag over Nora's head. At first I couldn't
figure out what she was doing, but then I realized that the mesh bags
looked a lot like the netting that beekeepers wear to keep bees off
of them while they're working in the hive.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Lily's a genius.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I grabbed another one
of the mesh bags and charged in, bravely, I might add (and do add),
and threw the hornet-infested ball inside it, drawing the strings as
tightly as I could. That sealed most of them inside the bag. I put
another one over my head, like Lily had done, and chased off the rest
of them using the hose.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;That old biddy,&quot;
I cursed at Ms. Rutherford as I sprayed off the last of the hornets,
wishing I could have her right here to spray in the face instead.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;What's going
on?&quot; asked the last person whose voice I wanted to hear right
now.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I pulled the bag off
my head and turned around to face her. She was looking all smug like
usual, with her rugged olive skin, her hair cut all short and boyish,
walking up to us in her gym shorts and shirt like some kind of
bigshot.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Ranta, my rival.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Nothing,&quot; I
said, even though that was obviously a lie. Here we were, me with a
hose, all three of us with mesh bags over our heads, yelling and
flapping in the middle of the field. Nora had somehow gotten trapped
inside her mesh bag and was rolling around on the grass trying to get
free.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Ranta didn't even
blink; she walked straight over to Nora and freed that klutz from the
bag, then helped her to her feet. &quot;Are you all right?&quot; she
asked.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Th-thank you...&quot;
Nora stammered.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Do you need some
help finishing this?&quot; Ranta asked, looking around at us.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;No!&quot; I
insisted.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Yes,&quot; Lily
and Nora contradicted me.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	There wasn't much left
to do, so having Ranta helping didn't really mean anything, but Nora
still acted like she was some kind of superhuman and kept buzzing
around her and chattering, like a honeybee and a honeysuckle.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	We finished moving
everything out of the hornet shed (except for the balls, which we
left along with a note to be careful of them) and into the other
shed, and were just about to go up to the faculty room and return the
keys when I heard Lily say something shocking to Ranta.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;You're Ranta,
right? The ace of the track team? I heard they stopped letting you
compete when they found out your gift was the Gift of Running. Would
you ever think about joining our club?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;No!&quot; I
butted in. &quot;Ranta would never think about joining this club.
It's not good enough for a high and mighty rich girl like her.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I would like to
join,&quot; said Ranta, &quot;but Cora might throw a tantrum, so I'd
better not. She's really such a whiny crybaby.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;You're confusing
me with Nora over there,&quot; I said. Then I saw Nora looking like
she was about to start crying. Crying because someone called you a
crybaby is exactly what it means to be a crybaby.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Really, she's so
unpleasant. I don't know why you tolerate her,&quot; said Ranta,
crossing her arms in a haughty way as she spoke. &quot;Lily, I have
an idea. Why don't you and Nora throw Cora out of the club, and I'll
replace her? It won't be long before you see that I'm stronger,
smarter, and nicer than she is.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I bit my lip. I really
wanted to say something, but I was afraid I'd already ruined myself
in Lily's eyes. Nora looked like she wanted to use Ranta's idea, but
Lily stood up for me.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Cora has good
things about her. She can be a little rambunctious, but she has a
good heart.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Oh, Lily...I knew you
wanted to be friends with me...I'm touched. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;By the way,
Cora, I thought you might want to know that you were eating my dust
in the last mile run. Seven minutes and sixteen seconds. Soon I'll be
down to the five minute mile of Lawrence of Arabia. What was your
time again? Nine minutes? Were you hopping on one leg the entire
time?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;You have the
Gift of Running! Obviously any competition where your gift gives you
an unfair advantage doesn't count!&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;The words of a
true loser. Since you're a born loser, Cora, you'll lose no matter
what we compete in. So go ahead, pick something. I'll prove to you
that you can't win against me.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Soccer!&quot; I
yelled. &quot;I bet you can't score one goal against me in soccer!
Tomorrow, after school. Be here, ready to lose against me!&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Fine. I'll prove
one more time that I'm better at sports than you are,&quot; said
Ranta, her arms crossed in that infuriating way. &quot;See you
tomorrow Lily, Nora. I hope you'll cheer for me.&quot; With that, she
left.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;She's pretty
gutsy, asking people from Cora's club to cheer for her in a match
against Cora,&quot; Lily commented.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I ground my teeth in
fury. Tomorrow, I swore, would be the day I made Ranta get down on
her hands and knees and bow to me!</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	The next day, during
lunch, I went to the library to look for Nora.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	We hadn't spoken at
all that morning; I'd been up late thinking about all the
embarrassing things I was going to force Ranta to do when I won, and
I hadn't gotten up the first time my alarm clock went off, so I had
just barely gotten to class on time and hadn't had a chance. When
lunch started, Nora ran off before I could catch her, and I hadn't
seen her in the dining hall, so I assumed she was at the library. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	The main library was a
huge castle-like building over by the high school. I didn't think
Nora would have time to walk over there, so I walked across the
courtyard to the smaller elementary school library. I'd never had
much use for the place, so I didn't really know how many books were
in it, but even a book freak like Nora couldn't have read all of
them.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I wasn't spending so
much time looking for Nora because I enjoyed her company. The truth
was, I might have gotten myself in too deep. As a cat, I can jump and
climb and roll better than any human, which makes me a good
goalkeeper in soccer; but Ranta's Gift of Running made her a brutal
kicker, since she could build up so much speed before hitting the
ball. I needed to be sure I could win. Anything, even the smallest
advantage, could give me the match.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	What? Don't look at me
like that. I'm not a cheater. This is something I would never do to
anyone but Ranta. I'm actually doing her a favor, by teaching her
that I'm better than she is.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I went into the
library and started looking around for Nora, checking all the tables
and in between all the shelves. The library was pretty empty at this
time, since most people over here don't love books enough to run off
during lunch and read them. That's why when I moved towards the back
corner, I heard their voices right away.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	It was Nora, and
Ranta.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	They were sitting
together in the window seat, like the one in the clubroom where I'd
found Nora sleeping. They were sitting close together, and a huge
leather-bound book was laid across their legs, with Nora holding the
left side and Ranta holding the right side. The title was <I>The
Poetry of William Blake</I>. Nora was reading out of it, and Ranta
was listening and following along.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;'Tyger, tyger,
burning bright, in the forest of the night,'&quot; Nora read. &quot;'What
immortal hand or eye, dare frame thy'--&quot; She stopped when she
saw me. &quot;Oh...Cora...&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Something about her
reaction made me mad. It was like she was disappointed to see me. I
scowled at her. &quot;Come with me. I need to talk to you.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Oh. Okay. Um,
I'll be back in a minute, Ranta.&quot;<BR>	&quot;I'll be right here,&quot;
said Ranta.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I led Nora back to the
front of the library, where we wouldn't be heard. &quot;What are you
doing?&quot; I asked. &quot;Don't you realize she's the enemy?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;She was n-nice
to me y-yesterday,&quot; Nora stammered, her mouth as always full of
marshmallows. &quot;And she l-likes books, s-so I said we should
r-read together sometime...&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Fine, well,
forget about that. I want you to help me with something.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Nora looked sullen,
but she nodded her head.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	What was with this
difference in treatment? It made me mad somehow.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Actually, this
could be even better. I want you to go to the PE shed before the
match and pick out the ball. Try to find one that's kind of flat.
That way it won't have as much force when Ranta kicks it, and I'll
have a better chance of being able to stop it. Ranta trusts you, so
she'll never think you did anything to the ball.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;That's
cheating!&quot; Nora flared, like a creampuff on fire. &quot;I don't
want to cheat Ranta!&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Shut up! Just do
it! Listen, you don't understand what kind of person Ranta is. Ever
since we were little, she's always thought she was better than
everyone else because she's rich and good at sports. It got even
worse after she found out what her gift was. This is really for her
own good. If she loses, she'll stop thinking she's better than
everyone else and become a better person in the end. Don't you think
that's a great plan?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;No,&quot; said
Nora.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	 I couldn't believe
this slimy little tadpole was disagreeing with me, so I just snarled,
&quot;Do it. Or else I won't talk to you in class.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	For a second, Nora
looked like she might have more to say, but she finally nodded and
then turned around and left without saying a word. &quot;And don't
tell Lily!&quot; I added to Nora's back. Lily was too good a person,
so she would stop me if she knew about this.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	By the time of the
match, I felt pretty bad about the way I'd treated Nora in the
library. She made me mad, but I was still a lot meaner to her than
I'd wanted to be. I felt especially bad about my threat not to talk
to her in class. I didn't really want to talk to her at all, but it
wasn't fair for me to talk to her only when I needed her for
something, so the second I'd asked her for a favor, I had lost the
right to not talk to her.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I put on my gym shorts
and my soccer jersey, tied my hair up in a ponytail at the back of my
head, and pulled on my shin guards, gloves, and cleats in my room
before going down. When Victoria saw me, she asked, &quot;Club?&quot;,
and I replied, &quot;Ranta.&quot; Victoria nodded and left it at
that.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Ranta and some of her
obnoxious friends had already arrived at the field when I came, and
so had Lily, but Nora wasn't there yet. Normally, we wouldn't have
been allowed to use the school's equipment for something like this
since it wasn't a school activity, but I had asked Ms. Rutherford and
she had allowed it, so the PE shed where we'd moved everything
yesterday was unlocked.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Ranta's friends
erupted in a chorus of booing and whistling when they saw me. They
were all rich girls, and they couldn't stand the idea of a commoner
like me challenging their champion, the snobbiest and most stuck up
of all the rich girls in this school.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I don't really
know why this is necessary, but good luck to both of you,&quot; said
Lily.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	The goal had already
been set up, so I took my place in front of it and stared into the
eyes of my enemy as we waited for Nora to get there with the ball.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;That creampuff,&quot;

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Nora finally arrived,
carrying a soccer ball in a mesh bag. She walked to where Ranta was
standing and placed the ball at Ranta's feet, then went to Lily's
side.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Ranta started to back
up. It looked like she was planning to use pure force to try and get
the ball past me as fast as possible so I wouldn't have time to stop
it. She was in for a nasty surprise.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I took a solid stance,

forward more.</FONT></FONT></P>

astonishment.</FONT></FONT></P>

I all took off. Since the other girls had already run off, the
hornets chased us.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	We ran across the
field as fast as we could, the buzzing cloud hot on our heels. Nora
started to fall behind at one point, and Ranta stopped and heaved her
up on her back and kept running, carrying that creampuff piggy-back. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Go for the
pool!&quot; said Lily. &quot;We can hide there until they lose
interest!&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	The middle school's
pool was about thirty yards away, well within reach. But come on, a
cat in a pool? Maybe a tiger could take it, but for a tabby like me,
getting soaked in water was about as much fun as going to the
dentist.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	But maybe it was
better than being chased by angry hornets. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I could see there was
a lock on the gate from far away, but we'd managed to gain about
twenty feet on the hornets, so there was time to deal with that. A
plum tree stood next to the fence, its branches reaching over the
fence. I took Nora from Ranta and clambered up the plum tree, over
the fence, and down on the other side with that creampuff clinging to
my back the whole time.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Get in!&quot; I
yelled, tossing her into the pool. There was a cover on it, but Nora
pulled it back at the corner and scrambled in. I jumped to the top of
the fence and helped Lily over, and then, graciously, I helped the
hopeless climber Ranta get up.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	By the time Ranta was
over, the hornets had reached us, so there was no time to think. We
dove into the pool at the corner and pulled the cover up over us,
waiting for the buzzing to stop.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	It was hot, dark, and
wet underneath that cover, and all the light that came through it was
blue. We'd ended up at the deep end of the pool, so we had to tread
water in our clothes while we waited for the buzzing to go away.
(None of us thought of moving to the shallow end.)</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Eventually, the
buzzing stopped, and we all came up. I was totally miserable, and I
just wanted to shake off my hair, squeeze out my clothes, and go curl
up on my bed for a while.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Where's Nora?&quot;
Lily asked.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I looked around. She
wasn't there.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	A sputtering noise
came from the pool.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Before I could even
think about going back in, Ranta had done a cannonball to the exposed
corner of the pool. Lily pulled back the cover and exposed Ranta,
holding on to a coughing and spluttering Nora and keeping her head
above water.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Lily and I helped pull
them out of the pool. Lily found a chair to put Nora on while I
stared Ranta down, trying to think of something to say about how
stupid she looked right now, her clothes all soaked and trails of
water dripping from her hair.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I finally gave up. I
probably looked twice as stupid, with my soaking wet tail hanging
down like a drowned rat and my ears pinned back to my head with the
weight of the water.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	Besides, she was the
one who had saved Nora, both from the bees and from drowning. Even
though Nora was annoying, I didn't want her to drown or get stung by
hornets, and Ranta was the one who had kept her safe.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;I believe in
giving credit to people when they do something good,&quot; I said. I
reached up to take off my glasses, but they weren't there. I saw them
floating in the pool. That must be why my vision was so blurry; I had
thought I just had water in my eyes. Instead I grabbed my tail and
started to squeeze water out of it.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Like I said,&quot;
I went on, &quot;I believe in giving credit to people when they
deserve it. So I have to give you credit, Ranta. You did a good job.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;That's very big
of you, Cora,&quot; said Ranta. &quot;Thank you for saying so. But
you did well too.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	We stood there for a
second, not quite knowing what to say. I didn't think I had ever said
anything nice to Ranta, and I knew she had never said anything nice
to me, so this was pretty weird.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;B-by the way,&quot;
I added, &quot;I got a thirty-eight on my last test.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Oh, r-really.
How nice,&quot; said Ranta.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Ah-ha! I can
tell from how you said that that you did worse than me! How bad was
it? A twenty? A fifteen?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&quot;Twelve,&quot;
Ranta admitted.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">
<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	I knew I was better
than her.</FONT></FONT></P>
