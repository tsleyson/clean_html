After all, I've met a succubus, an incubus, a girl who gave birth to a demon child, said demon child, and some of what demon children grow up to be in just the last few days.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> But I hadn't felt insane until this moment.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> It was knowing, <span class="T1">knowing</span><span class="T2">, having seen with my own eyes, that something had happened, and having no one at all believe it. Having no way to prove it. Being unable to tell anyone the full story. It made me feel crazy.</span></span></p><p class="P1"><span> I had felt pressured to publish, pressured to ruin Austen, to weaken his ability to strike at me, and I had published without having a single victim or witness willing to testify against him. </span></p><p class="P1"><span> I had expected Amber would deny it.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I had expected Amber's mother wouldn't know a thing about it.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> That's why I had gone so far as to betray Mrs. Sullivan by publishing her full name, as I had told her I wouldn't do, hoping that once the real reporters were knocking on her door, she'd find herself willing to talk. Granted, her story wasn't exactly a shocking indictment of Austen—she hadn't even connected her son's condition to the pastor until I asked her for some connection between all the victims—but it would have at least made it harder to dismiss the allegations as the work of some online prankster.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Then I had tricked Lucy by sending her a text message saying my story was done and up, knowing she would look at it the next morning and that very few others would. In that version, I had mentioned only the first names 'June' and 'Jane', and I had switched them, describing 'Jane' as the mother of the elementary school boy and 'June' as the mother of the teenage girl.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> As soon as Sophia dropped me off after school that day, I had raced up to my room and edited the posting, switching 'June' and 'Jane' back to their proper owners, and adding last names to boot.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Lucy would find out eventually, but I had only needed to trick her until the story was picked up by someone else. Once she found out, she would be angry. She would be disappointed. She might even refuse to answer my calls for a week. As hard as it would be, I could live with that.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I couldn't refuse a direct order from her.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> If she had found out before I published and had ordered me not to release Mrs. Sullivan's name, I would have had to obey. That's the sort of relationship we have.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> And if she had given me a direct order, and I had obeyed it and not published Mrs. Sullivan's name, I would have lost my only chance to ruin Austen quickly.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Now it was lost anyway. Mrs. Sullivan had refused to talk.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Maybe someone from the network would harass her and get her to talk eventually, or maybe someone else would make a complaint against Austen and get things rolling, but until then, it looked like I was going to be riding the succubus taxi to school every day. Austen may have decided to let me go after I failed to ruin him, but he might think I still knew something, or he might just be the vindictive type.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Something I just said rang a bell.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> 'Maybe someone else would make a complaint against Austen'.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Someone else had made a complaint.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> They had just been ignored.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I broached the subject with Sophia the next day in the car.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "The Robsons," I said.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Is that some classic cartoon? I thought I was familiar with them all."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "No, you idiot, they're the couple that Amber brought the money to. Their son was in the hospital getting a C-section to remove the demon child."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "You can't sit in heavy, thoughtful silence, refusing all attempts at conversation, for over thirty minutes and then suddenly say 'the Robsons' and expect me to know what you're talking about," she fairly countered.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I hated her for the fairness of her countering.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I mean, I published my story. I outed Mrs. Sullivan, hoping she would testify against Austen, but she didn't, so I thought I was pretty much screwed," I said.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Oh, this isn't so bad. You get to ride to school in a car every day. You were thrilled the first few days. I half-expected you to stick your head out the window and let your tongue wag."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "But I forgot the Robsons," I continued, ignoring her attempt to treat me like a dog again. "They knew Austen had something to do with their son's condition. They tried to press charges. Even if they took his money in the end, they might still be willing to talk. Even if it's a weak testimony, it'll be enough to show that the whole thing wasn't made up by some jackass with too much time on his hands, and in an area like this, even a weak testimony could go a long way."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "That's pretty impressive. As expected of you, you come up with the ideas that no one else has," Sophia said guilelessly.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Stop praising me like I'm a precocious three-year-old."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "But you make me want to praise you as if you're a precocious three-year-old."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Another thought occurred to me. "By the way, where are you in all this?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "What do you mean?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "You're a succubus. Austen is an incubus. You could solve this problem right away, unless Austen's too strong for you."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "No, I think he's quite weak. He even used a gun, did you notice?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Yeah, and he couldn't even do that right."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I think he doesn't have many powers beyond making demon children. If I needed to fight him, I could win, most likely. But as much as I regret it, I have to work under certain restrictions. One of them is that I don't do conspicuous things like killing the well-known pastor of a small town."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "You cut his hand off!"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Yes, to protect you, because he couldn't do much other than go to the hospital to get it reattached and tell them that he had an accident with his table saw. If he dies, people will notice."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "If it's okay to cut his hand off to protect me, then just think of this as preemptively protecting me."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "It's not so simple. In actuality, I probably shouldn't be protecting you. I'm sorry, James, but all I can do is protect you from direct attacks. I can't do anything else for you unless I have evidence that Austen is planning to do something that could reveal his identity as a supernatural creature on a large scale."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Tch, you're useless."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "You're going to make me cry."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I was about to snap at her not to joke around when it was my life she was refusing to preemptively protect, but she honestly did look a little sad, so I held back my anger and dropped the subject.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Guess I'll have to settle for a human solution.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> As usual, I had not brought my cell phone, so when we arrived at the college, I asked Sophia if I could borrow hers. She handed it over without complaint. When I saw it was the newest model iPhone, I raised my hand to smash it against the dashboard, but she might kill me if I smashed her phone in a jealous rage, so I resisted my anger that this frumpy-looking computer nerd succubus had been hiding the newest iPhone in addition to her Audi and stylish wardrobe and dialed the Santa Robles social services office. I asked the receptionist who answered to connect me with someone I knew in the office. </span><span> His name was Daniel Franklin. We'd met while I was reporting on a local crack whore's children being taken away for the eighteenth time.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> When he found out I was a college student, the first thing he'd told me was that I shouldn't even consider majoring in humanities, creative writing, or any sort of literature. That's how you end up like him, he told me.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> The second thing he'd told me was "I ask of you, are you my Master?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> He loved Saber-chan.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> He loved her more than his job or common decency.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Thus, we had forged a bond.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Hello, you've reached Daniel Franklin," he said when I got through.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Daniel, it's James Moran," I said.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Oh, James. I saw your story about Joseph Austen the other night. Dude, what were you thinking? You should've like, taken a chill pill before writing that, man."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> As soon as he knew it was me, his style of speech changed into that of a teenager from an '80s movie.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> It was pretty annoying, but I guess he was trying to make me feel comfortable around him in his own way. Either that, or he was just a fat man-child who existed only to buy overpriced import goods. But I needed him, so I tolerated his annoying points.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I need some information relating to that," I told him.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Give it up, man. Austen's invincible."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Then I'm dead." I told him, as quickly as I could, about the incident with JZ and his gang.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Dude, that's like, a total bummer. Maybe you could, like, get the cops to round up those guys, and one of them would sell out Austen for a plea deal?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "In the meantime, Austen will just hire someone else to finish me, and maybe whoever ratted on him too."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "All right, all right. What d'you need, man?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I want to know if you have any information on the Robson family. I don't know the parents' names, but they had a child named Richard."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "All right...lemme see here..."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I'll spare you any more of his 'dude' and 'man' and just get straight to the point.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> There was a Robson family with a child called Richard in the computer. A short time ago, Child Protective Services had taken Richard away, claiming that his parents were abusing him. The parents had been put on trial for said abuse and had lost. The father had been sent to county jail for a year. The mother, on the other hand, had made a statement, against the advisement of her lawyer, claiming that Austen had raped and somehow impregnated their son. When the doctors and nurses who had supposedly performed her son's C-section were nowhere to be found, she too had gone to jail for a while, but she'd been moved to a mental hospital. Daniel gave me their names and the name and address of the mental hospital, then hung up with a "Chill dude. I'm sure Caliburn will manifest in time to defeat this Berserker."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> It's really horrible when he hangs up like that.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I almost felt physical discomfort at the awfulness of that line.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Once I had hung up on him, I turned to Sophia and demanded that she drive to the jailhouse so I could speak with Arthur Robson.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Class begins in fifteen minutes. I'll take you afterward."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "This is more important than hearing what new idiocy Latrom is going to come up with or exploring exciting new vistas of boredom with Pandit! It affects you too—if I can ruin Austen, you won't have to drive me to school anymore."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I don't mind driving you to school."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Besides, this is the fifth time you've taken these classes! Aren't you even a little sick of them by now?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Fine, fine. By the way, may I have my phone back?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I reluctantly gave it back to her.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> For being a jail, the jailhouse was surprisingly nice. It was newer than some of the buildings at the school; the floors were clean, and none of the tiles were falling off the walls, and it didn't have that same ambiance of decay and decline that most of the college's buildings had, and there wasn't mold growing underneath decades of dirt behind the sideboards. All in all, it seemed like a decent enough place to pay a debt to society.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> However, when I asked the clerk if I could visit Arthur Robson, the clerk replied,</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Guess you hadn't heard. Robson got shanked a few days ago. He died last night."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> and shattered my hopes of resolving this quickly.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Austen must be behind this.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> He was tying up all the loose ends, making sure I (or someone like me) couldn't bring him to the brink of ruin again.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I next had Sophia drive me to the mental hospital.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> It was outside of town, which was why I had gone to the jail first.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> She had known more or less how to get to the jail, but for this she had to turn on her fancy GPS. </span><span> When it said "Turn left at the light ahead" in its pleasing female voice and we arrived without once stopping to yell for directions at a pedestrian or fumbling in the glove compartment for a map that would never be folded up correctly again, I wanted to smash it against the dashboard.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> After getting in by telling an uppity, suspicious orderly that I was Wenjing Robson's distant cousin by marriage, I was escorted to a large, open room and told to wait for someone to bring Mrs. Robson out. After a moment they brought out a tall Chinese woman. I could see the traces of a self-assured gait, a straight-backed posture, the sharp gaze of a career woman, but they were only traces; for the most part, she was hunched, shuffling, and a bit hazy in the eyes.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Hello, Mrs. Robson, my name is James Moran," I told her. "I write a blog about local news."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "You're here about Pastor Austen, aren't you."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Even in her medicated haze, it seemed she was pretty sharp.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Yes. I published a story a few days ago, but none of the people I spoke to were willing to repeat their stories to the real reporters, so I ended up getting written off as a crackpot."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I don't know what good I can do you. They told me I'm a paranoid schizophrenic. That means I'm paranoid and crazy. They won't listen to the testimony of a paranoid, crazy person."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I know the story about your son being pregnant was true."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> That stopped her for a second. "How do you...?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I've seen evidence. But you'd think I was the one who belonged in here if I told you. Please just tell me everything you know about Austen. To the recorder, if you don't mind." I took out my small digital recorder and showed it to her.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> She shrugged. "I guess if there's even a small chance..."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Almost a year ago, Mrs. Robson told me, her son had started acting strange. Like the Sullivan boy, he'd become depressed and started acting out. They took him to a counselor, but it didn't help. Then, after a few months, his stomach became distended. His parents rushed him to the hospital, and the doctors ran various tests on him.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> An ultrasound found something growing inside him. Something that looked remarkably like a baby.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> When Richie heard this, he started to cry. He told his parents that Austen had touched him the way you touch someone to make a baby with them. The Robsons raised a fuss at the school, but Austen managed to talk his way out of it somehow. They had tried to find other victims among the parents of children in Austen's after-school program, but had no luck. They had finally hired a private investigator to look into Austen.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> The private investigator discovered that over the years, Austen had molested over thirty children in his after-school program. The first victims were now in their twenties; most of them had never told anyone. Any who had spoken up had disappeared somehow, usually moving away, but sometimes dying mysteriously along with their parents in car accidents or freak meat grinder incidents. Several victims had been pregnant; one, Amber Linney, had been pregnant almost ten times.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> At this I had stopped her. "Wait. Amber told me her first pregnancy took about three months, and that it happened when she was thirteen. There wasn't enough time for her to be pregnant ten times."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "No, thirteen sounds correct for ten of them," said Mrs. Robson.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "But at three months each, that only leaves enough time for four in a year."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "And twelve in three years."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> So that was a lie.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Well, all women lie about their ages.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> In addition to impregnating the children in his program, Austen had spent his nights and weekends going around and impregnating any woman he could find in the bars in nearby towns, as well as hiring prostitutes with church funds so he could get them pregnant too. The investigator even discovered that Austen had had a huge crate of some kind of date rape drug delivered to his house, probably so he could impregnate people even against their will.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> The Robsons were prepared to bring all the evidence they had to the police. Just before doing so, they refused the money that Amber brought to their son's hospital room.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Then came the abuse trial.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> The rest, I had heard.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I honestly didn't think I could use this.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> By the way, before I left, Mrs. Robson asked me if I knew anything about how her son was doing. Daniel had told me he was with a foster family and had been having trouble adjusting, but I doubted she wanted to hear that, so this:</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "He's fine, but I'm sure he misses his mother."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> is what I said, and she cried a little. I think she would have cried no matter what I said, so worrying about it was meaningless.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Did you find anything out?" Sophia asked when I returned to the car.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Not a damn thing."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> On the way back to the school, I played Mrs. Robson's story for her.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Is this enough for your rules? He's killing people, ruining lives, breaking up families, and probably also jaywalking—isn't that enough for your rules?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I'm sorry...I'm really, truly sorry for that woman and what's happened to her...but all of that is still a human problem."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "He's using his incubus powers on people."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "But he's not doing it conspicuously, and that's the key. The rules weren't designed to protect humans from supernatural creatures. It's actually the opposite—they were made to protect supernatural creatures from humans."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I couldn't believe it.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "You people are all messed up and backwards, then, because when I see one person who can grow blades out of her fingers and regenerate from a bullet wound in milliseconds, not to mention suck the life force out of men with sex, and the other person can die from stepping on a rusty nail if he happens to have an out of date tetanus vaccine, I can't help thinking it's the second guy who needs to be protected. It's like sticking George Foreman in the ring with Rick Moranis—by your logic, Moranis needs to be handicapped."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Sophia shook her head.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Of course that's true in a hand-to-hand fight, or when we have the advantage of being hidden, but on a societal level, it isn't. Think of a village menaced by wild man-eating tigers. Of course, if a tiger takes a human by surprise in the bush, the human can't hope to fight off the tiger. But if the village bands together and takes rifles out into the jungle to hunt down the tigers, the tigers can't win, because they're outnumbered and disorganized."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "It's the same for supernatural creatures. We once lived more openly. A band of seven vampires could defeat an entire army of mounted knights and foot soldiers, so we had nothing to fear. And even if a few people discovered us, evidence of our existence couldn't be circulated on a large scale, so governments and institutions would never organize against us. But the printing press ended that. We couldn't be so open anymore, because the villagers had finally connected the dots on all those disappearances and figured out that tigers had done it, and they put together hunting parties. The fact of our existence and the methods for killing us could be easily spread. Weapons technology advanced as well—a vampire's claws are just as useless as a tiger's against a gun. And we've never been organized as a single society. There are too many species, with competing needs and worldviews. Secrecy was our only hope to survive. We couldn't allow vampires to take over entire villages, or attack royalty, or hold hedonistic parties where nobles paid to be turned anymore, because those things would alert the humans to our existence, and the rampant witch burnings in Europe made it pretty clear what would come of that. That's why we made the rules, and that's why I can't kill Austen for you—because he isn't breaking them."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "So getting little boys pregnant isn't conspicuous enough for you?" I asked.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I..." She looked genuinely miserable, and didn't say anything.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I knew what she was going to say.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "No one believes in that except you and one woman who's in a mental hospital."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> That was the reason, but she knew how monstrous, how inhuman it would be to say it</span></p><p class="P1"><span> She was a hypocrite.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> She was a weakling.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> But she was kind. </span></p><p class="P1"><span> Her kindness made her a hypocrite and a weakling.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> And because of that, I gave up on my species.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Fine, fine. You don't have to say anymore, I understand. So I just need to find proof that Austen is planning something big, right? Something on the scale of taking over an entire village? I think I can get that for you. If I find something, you'll take him out for me?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Still looking miserable, she nodded. "It's a deal."</span></p></body></html>
