As a penalty, you have to put up with that lurching, heaving feeling in your stomach. I really wasn't into that right now, so I resisted the urge to throw up.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I could feel splinters and grit beneath me, and surmised that I was lying on a wood floor. It was dark, and I could smell the coolness of dew from somewhere, so I guessed that I'd been unconscious for a couple hours and night had fallen.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I didn't seem to be tied up or bound in any way, so I pushed myself to my knees, and felt a wave of pain smite my head. Despite that, I bravely got to my feet, felt another wave of pain smite my head, stumbled, and caught myself.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I'm full of courage today.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I wanted to look around and find out where I was, but it was dark and I couldn't see, so I couldn't do much but stand there in the middle of the dirt-covered wood floor.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Long I stood there, wondering, fearing, doubting.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Until I heard the hinges of a door creak, and a bare lightbulb dangling from the roof lit up a circle about eight feet in diameter in the center of the room.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I moved into the light.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Hello, James," said a voice I had never heard, though I could guess who owned it.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Joseph Austen.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> He was shorter than I expected, just about five feet six inches. His curly hair was greased back, revealing a high forehead, and he wore a light grey suit, and as he stepped down the rickety wooden stairs into what I assumed was the church basement, he let his wingtips fall with ominous slowness, until I asked if he was walking so slowly because he was arthritic.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Then he scurried down quickly enough.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "I hear you've been looking into my affairs, James," said Austen. "Are you with the media?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "I'm with the new media."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Surely you'll appreciate the tenuousness of your position. I am a respected member of this community. You are a nosy child playing with your computer. If you were to suddenly stop playing with your computer, who would notice?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Are you trying to threaten me? Are you Don Corleone? Are you trying to make me an offer I can't refuse? Yeah, you paid JZ to beat me up, but you're a pastor from a nothing town in the Sierra foothills, not a mob boss. You can't make me disappear. You might notice I'm still here, despite the best efforts of your hired thugs. Soon I'll release the story, and you'll be finished. I can already see the headlines--'Trusted pastor molests parishioners' children. Super-reporter James Moran uncovers story.' All I'm worried about now is making sure I don't get pregnant from any attempted gay rape."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I said.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> When actually, I was scared out of my wits.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I wanted to cry.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I wanted to talk to Lucy.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I'd even settle for an economics lecture from Pandit.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Anything to be somewhere other than here.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Austen was smiling.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Never a good sign when you're completely in the bad guy's power and he's smiling.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Don't worry about that. You're far too <span class="T1">old </span><span class="T2">for my taste, James. But my children need fresh food every so often. They can't live forever on dead things."</span></span></p><p class="P1"><span> As if turned on by another switch, dozens of pairs of glowing red orbs appeared in the darkness around me, blinking, winking. I could hear heavy breathing and slobbering.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span class="T2">        I could see the outline of a very large humanoid shape behind one pair of glowing orbs. Lanky, </span><span class="T2">long limbs. Arms and legs thick with muscle. Eight feet tall. Eight.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Pallid grey skin. Wiry black hair.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Rows of sharp teeth, grinning at me.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Monkey-like tail. Stinger.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> This must be what baby monkey grew up to be.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I wondered if it could fish for termites with a blade of grass.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> As more shapes began to fade in around me, I realized that I had one chance to escape.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> The single door. Only Austen was standing in front of it. As wimpy as I am, Austen was shorter and older than me. I should be able to take him by surprise, knock him over, and get through the door.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> So I thought.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> But as soon as I made a dash for it and Austen, rather than trying to stop me, stepped aside and let me go, I knew it was futile.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I leaped to the top of the stairs and twisted the doorknob.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> It went nowhere.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Do you take me for an imbecile? Of course I locked the door when I came in," said Austen.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Well, here we go. It's really it this time. I'll try smashing my shoulder into the door a few times, but I don't expect I can break through it. I'm done. Eaten by demonic monkey creatures with stingers. Austen will probably rape my corpse just to get back at me for making fun of him.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Then I heard a soft voice.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Not Austen's. A woman's. Through the door.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Get away from the door!"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I did, just in time; the door flew open so hard it almost came off its rusted, squeaky hinges, and in sauntered the last thing you'd ever expect to see in a church.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> It was a sexy girl in her underwear.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Well, she had long, flaming red hair, and her eyes were gold and seemed to be glowing, and were those wings? Yes, big bat-like wings sticking straight out of her back. But her most prominent features were her sexiness and her in-her-underweariness. </span></p><p class="P1"><span> Although now that I looked, her underwear wasn't very sexy.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> It had strawberries on it.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Seems you don't smell very well," she said to Austen. "I've marked this male. He's my prey. If you wish to feed him to your bastard children, you'll have to contend with me."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Interrupting her cool speech, I asked the question whose answer most interested me at the moment.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Why are you in your underwear?" I asked.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Why am I—is that the first thing you focus on?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "And it's got strawberries on it."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Because! Because, you can't expect me to fight in that skirt, can you? I'm in my underwear for you, idiot! Be grateful!"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> ...She got mad.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> But there was no mistake that I was grateful to this computer nerd succubus for being in the area when I needed rescuing, again, for the second time. Although--</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "And what do you mean, you marked me? You were planning to sex me to death after all, weren't you?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Just shut up and let me save you!" she screamed.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Austen had been strangely quiet during our pointless exchange. He stared at the succubus with a wary expression. I had seen it before. It was the look that eighth-grade bullies had gotten when they were bullying me and my sister suddenly showed up. A look that meant ego and sense were arguing over the wisdom of fighting the recently entered person, with ego arguing that they couldn't back down and sense arguing that they couldn't win.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Good evening. I smelled no trace of the scent of one of my kind," said Austen. "Please accept my sincere apologies."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I am not one of your kind," she snarled. "No matter how you mean it, I am not."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> ...Scary.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I'd have to be careful about getting her mad in the future.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> The future? The only future I'm interested in is one without computer nerd succubuses (or any other kind). Even if I am the Jude Law of succubuses, it's just too much, facing this kind of danger.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Children, please stand down," said Austen.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Then he disappeared into the darkness.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> And Bigfoot struck.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> He moved so fast that Sophia didn't even have time to blink; just as I had been unable to avoid the attack from Amber's little Capuchin, Sasquatch's huge, meaty fist swung in too fast to dodge and pulverized her pretty face into a mess of blood, meat, and bone.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> What a waste of a good-looking sort of girl.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> So I thought, but when the spray cleared, although her face was covered with blood, it didn't seem to be any worse for wear.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Someone's been feeding you well," Sophia commented. "You're stronger than most I've seen."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> The tail swung up, but this time she wasn't caught off guard. She grabbed the stinger in her left hand, and an instant later, it had detached from the rest of the tail.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Claws—no, talons, like those of a bird of prey, like those the eagles must have used to carry Bilbo up to their eyries—had sprung from her fingers.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Those creepy gold eyes flared up, and as Sasquatch recoiled, in shock from losing his stinger, that cute, intelligent, slightly ditzy computer nerd succubus jumped at him in her underwear and sank all five talons on her right hand into his chest.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Those talons were unreasonably huge. They looked sharp, too.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Picture Edward Scissor-Hands.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> They really made a mess of Sasquatch's chest, carving out a cavity around his heart like he was a Thanksgiving turkey.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Then the left hand, equally as full of huge, sharp talons, each like the gladius of a Roman legionnaire, swung around and swept through Sasquatch's head, leaving it scattered around the room in five bloody slices.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> And she looked around the room at the other figures, still half-visible in the darkness, and roared, like a mountain lion, as if to say "Who else wants some?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> ...Scary.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> The other Abominable Snowmen evidently agreed, because they sank back into the darkness.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Let's go." She reached a hand out to me as she passed, and I recoiled, expecting to be skewered by talons, but they were gone.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> That's a neat trick. Sort of like Wolverine retracting his claws.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Just to make her feel better, I took her hand and let her lead the way up to the regular basement of the church, and up the drafty staircase back to the worship room. I repeat, it was just to make her feel like she was doing a good job of rescuing me. It definitely wasn't because I was terrified, or on the edge of an anxiety attack after nearly being eaten by those things in there, or struggling to walk because my legs wanted to collapse under me, and there certainly wasn't a small part of me that enjoyed touching the skin of a sexy girl in her underwear, even if it was just the skin of her hand and the underwear had strawberries. Those motives did not come into play at all; it was purely charity from me to her. It was the least I could do for her, with this being the second time she'd rescued me in as many days.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> At this point, I should probably mention something that didn't seem important at the time, but in retrospect, may have been rather significant. To hear about this, we must cast our minds back to last night, before the succubus and I had parted ways at the corner of Holly and Vine. We were walking and talking under the orange sky.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I was curious as to how a succubus lives.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I lead a very boring life," was her reply. "I do homework. I like to watch <span class="T1">Jeopardy </span>in the evenings. I read whatever's on the bestseller's shelf at the library. I feed my cat. I take walks often, and jog every morning. I sometimes go hiking in the hills. I usually cook my own food."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "French cooking?" I asked.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "If by 'French cooking' you mean that the person who cooked it is French. Most of what I make is pretty simple."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "And you eat regular food?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I can't die of hunger or thirst as long as I've fed, but I still feel pain from them. And I still enjoy eating."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Do you at least get fussy about wine?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I don't drink it."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Cognac?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I don't drink it."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Cheese?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I get fussy if it's too runny or smells bad."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Bread?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I buy it from Safeway's bakery."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Chocolate?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups and Hershey's Symphony bars with Nilla Wafers."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Fashion?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Look at how I'm dressed."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Jerry Lewis?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Never heard of him."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Foie gras?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I feel sorry for those ducks they use to make it."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Truffles?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I'd rather not eat something that had a pig's nose all over it."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Filet mignon?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "It's good, but overpriced."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Tintin?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I could talk for hours about it!"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Finally, some evidence that this girl was French.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "By the way, that might be why I had a good feeling about you from early on," she added. "You're sort of like Tintin."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I've never been so flattered," I said. "But couldn't you have said John Constantine? He's the one I modeled my life after. I'm aiming to get lung cancer and be resurrected before too long."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> She giggled.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> No, I'm not joking.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> She actually giggled.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Well, I've got to go this way," she said, pointing down the street.</span><br/><span> "Oh, okay."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Good night."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Good--"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> The reason I did not finish saying good night was that she suddenly seized the back of my head, leaned in, and kissed me. With tongue.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> In a porn movie, this would have segued into the two of us having sex in a back alley that looks suspiciously like someone's garage with some garbage cans in it. In the worst case, it might have a bare mattress on the floor too. I was terrified that she planned to make that same segue in real life, even if we could find a convenient bare mattress in one of these alleys.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> If she did, it would end with me as a dried-out husk.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> But after about 3.5 seconds, she pulled her tongue out, released me, and ran off at a rather impressive speed in the direction she had pointed.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I mention this now because she had twice said things like "I impressed my scent on you" and "I marked this male", and unless she can do such things just by thinking about it without any physical contact, that must have been the reason why she suddenly stuck her tongue down my throat last night.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Either that or my lips just looked so kissable in the light of the setting sun that she couldn't resist.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I was going from the Jude Law of succubuses to the Angelina Jolie of succubuses.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> In any case, knowing that this happened is relevant to what I said next, which was, "Did you put some weird succubus scent mark on me when you stole my first kiss the other night?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Yes."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Don't do that! I don't want some weird succubusy-smelling oils that will never wash off on me!"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "It's too late."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "So now everyone's going to think I'm your chalupa?!"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Something like that." She nodded, affirming with both words and actions that she was a terrible person, a rapist who forced innocent young men to become her sex slaves by stealing their first kisses and leaving weird smells all over them.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Let go of my hand!" I tried to pull it free.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I won't, and you can't get free from me!"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> She was right.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Her grip strength was unbelievable.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> There was a surprise waiting for us in the main room of the church, sort of like the surprise you experience on Christmas morning, except this was actually a child-molesting incubus with a gun.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> He had a gun.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> He had no pride as an infernal being. What kind of demonic being uses a gun?</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Don't mention <span class="T1">Devil May Cry</span>—when I failed to beat the last boss for the eighty-ninth time, I erased its existence from my world.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Miss," said Austen. "You'll pardon me for not trusting you, since we've only just met, but I do need that boy to die. Would you mind taking him right here, so I can be sure that he's dead?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Do you really want to see her bang me that badly?" I asked.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Austen ignored me, that gun—it was a revolver, probably a .45, but that was as far as my knowledge of guns went—trained on me, while his eyes focused on Sophia. I wondered if he was passing her some kind of succubus telepathy saying <span class="T1">"Please, please, please!"</span> After all, he had just tried to kill her too, and now he had the gall to ask if he could watch her have sex with me?</span></p><p class="P1"><span> If he was begging in triplicate via telepathy, Sophia was totally ignoring him, because she was tensed up, her teeth were bared, and her fingers were curled into claws, looking ready to spring blades any second now. "I would mind," she said.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Then I reckon I'll have to shoot him," said Austen, and he pulled the trigger.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> She was in front of me when it hit.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Austen's aim was total crap; the bullet would have hit the floor before it got to me, but Sophia was closer to him than I was, and the burning chunk of metal tore through her left hip, cutting a path through blood, flesh, and bone.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Then the talons reappeared.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Hey, hey, those look even bigger than before. They're almost as long as your whole body.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> She flicked her right wrist upward.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Next thing I knew, Austen's left hand had detached from his arm, along with the revolver it held.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> It took him a second, but he started moaning and clutching at the wound in a rather pathetic manner, trying to wrap the stump in his shirt to stem the blood loss. </span></p><p class="P1"><span> I wanted to laugh at him, but since I almost wet myself when I was surrounded by those Abominable Snowmen of his, I felt that I could not do so in good conscience.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Sophia, meanwhile, commenced ignoring Austen almost as soon as his hand had parted from his wrist. "I left my clothes on one of these pews, but I don't remember which," she said. "Ah, here we go. Would you mind turning around while I get dressed?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I did so, too distracted by the screaming and moaning and flowing blood to ask why she needed me to turn around when she was already in her underwear.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> </span></p><p class="P1"><span> </span></p><p class="P1"><span> </span></p></body></html>
