So you were already aware that he was suspicious. I also have to investigate people often, but I only follow orders, so I think it would pretty hard if you had to decide for yourself whether someone needs to be checked out. That's pretty amazing."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I tried not to let it go to my head, but it was hard with her.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> She was just so damned, so damned likable.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> So hard to dislike</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> So easy to feel positively towards.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Having this cute, intelligent, slightly ditzy woman in front of me even made it hard to be afraid of the life-stealing creature in the red dress I had seen last night.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> That was the scariest part of all.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I told her what information I had gathered so far. She added two major pieces to what I had discovered:</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "I said before that an incubus is like a male succubus, but that isn't really true. They do have the same ability to entrance humans as us, but they don't need to take life force from humans to live. If an incubus, er, spends the night with a willing human woman, she'll give birth to a demon child, like that girl Amber described."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I asked what she meant by 'willing'.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Well, it's hard to say for sure, because no one can know exactly what someone was thinking at the moment she was with an incubus, but if she feels positively towards him when they're together, she'll usually have a demon childbirth. From what you say, that girl Amber felt like she was repaying Austen's favor when they were together."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> What happens if she doesn't feel positively towards the incubus?</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Well, I'm sorry to say that you're looking at the result of that."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Hah. Sorry for your loss.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Don't talk about it like my cat died or something."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> The second major piece of information was this:</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Incubi can impregnate men. Don't ask me how it works. After I finish my degree in biology, I'll da Vinci one and we can find out. But I've seen it happen. In the old days, the demon child would tear through the man when it was ready to be born, but it sounds like those boys got into the hospital and had them surgically removed."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "By the way, men can't become succubi, but I'm not sure how it works beyond that," she added.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> So that made it pretty much a done deal: Austen was a child-molesting incubus. Since all these kids trusted him, he was able to sex them up and implant them with demon children. No telling what the boys' parents had done with their little bundles of joy, but from the sound of it, they could walk within minutes of birth and would go out looking for something to kill and eat as soon as they could walk, so it was doubtful that Amber's demon child had died from being left at the edge of the trailer park.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Now the question was what to do about it.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> The police weren't likely to help.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I'd told Amber the police department was full of people wanting to become heroes by busting a child-molester, but that was a lie. I'd seen inside the Santa Robles police department.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> It tended to be soft on the locals, and even softer on anyone affiliated with religion. Austen was both.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Publishing a story was likely to be even more of an uphill battle.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> As a last resort, I had asked our friendly neighborhood succubus if she could do anything about this, but she had said, "Sorry, I think what he's doing is terrible, but I can only act according to the rules, and the rules won't let me do anything in this situation." and forfeited all responsibility.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> So as I walked towards the next bus stop in the darkness of early evening, having missed my usual bus because somebody couldn't stop blathering (oh wait, that was me), I thought about what to do.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Apparently she lived in town somewhere, so she had walked with me to the corner of Vine Way and Holly Avenue before splitting off and leaving me to think about how to solve this.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> A human's problems were simple. A succubus could easily solve them, just as a first-grader's problems were simple and could easily be solved by an adult.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> But in the end, a first-grader has to solve a first-grader's problems, and a human has to solve a human's problems. Putting aside the issue of the demon children, Austen was a human problem.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Of course, a human could also solve a succubus's problem. I had solved her problem by giving her my information, but when I pointed this out to her, she said, "I'm extremely grateful for that, and I'll certainly find some way to show my gratitude, but I can't go outside the rules. I'm sorry." and procrastinated the day when she would have to pay me back, like someone charging up a credit card and then making only the minimum payment.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> If a human could solve a succubus's problems, it stood to reason that a human could solve an incubus's problems.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Or rather, a group of humans.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Like the group of humans surrounding me right now.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "You James?" one of them asked. "You da fool been gettin all in Pastor Austen's bidniss?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I guessed they weren't just a bunch of overzealous Sunday School teachers.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Rather, I knew, from their red armbands, that they were with one of the local street gangs.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> By the way, you may have gotten the impression that that guy who asked for my name was African-American, from the way he spoke. That was not the case. He was, in reality, far whiter than me. When I didn't immediately answer his question, he approached me, thrusting his milky white cheeks, covered with freckles, towards me in a threatening manner. His close-shaved ginger red hair allowed an even more pale scalp to shine through like a full moon, and there were freckles all up and down the arms he raised to make some rap gesture at me.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> By the way, all five of his cohorts, two of whom were standing by his side in front of me and two of whom had somehow gotten behind me at some point, were Hispanic.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> It seems that even in gangs, minorities have a hard time getting promoted to management positions.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "No, my name is Steve," I said, finally answering the question.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I didn't really expect them to believe me, but I had to try.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Nah, you James," said the great white hope. "I seen a pitcha."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> This was the second time today I had discovered that someone I didn't want knowing anything about me had discovered things about me.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> It wasn't a pleasant feeling, but I figured the beating I was about to receive if I couldn't escape these guys would feel even more unpleasant.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> By the way, I don't fight. I never have. When I was younger, my sister handled the fights. She took jujitsu from a young age and was a second-degree black belt by the time she was fourteen. My job was always more of a supporting role. I would watch her trash some guys and then make fun of them because they got trashed by a girl four years (or more) younger than they were.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Unfortunately, she was in New York right now, along with her second-degree black belt in jujitsu.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> And I was here, surrounded by five gang bangers.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Still, I had done that gang story, as that computer nerd succubus insisted on reminding me, so it wasn't like I had never talked to people like this before. Of course, that experience just reinforced how hopeless it was to think I could talk my way out of this situation; guys like this were usually friendly enough if you were on their good side, but if you weren't, they weren't about to give you a chance to get on it.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I tried anyway.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Listen, man, I never did anything to you guys," I ventured. "I got no problem with you." I looked around at all of them, hoping that even if the great white hope wouldn't listen, one of the others might.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> No dice.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Why're you guys working for Joseph Austen anyway?" I asked. "You know he bangs little kids? He's a sicko?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Man, I don't give no half shit 'bout none a that, so long as I gettin paid," said the great white hope, killing off all of my hopes. "An' I be gettin paid to make sure you don't never get up in Austen's bidness again, know what I'm sayin?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I did know what he was saying.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> And so did the rest of them, since they started closing in around me.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Plan B.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I took out my camera. "This camera is connected to the Internet," I said. "If I take pictures of you, it'll go straight to my computer. My family knows about it. They'll bring the pictures to the cops."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> That was a lie. The camera <span class="T1">was </span><span class="T2">hooked up like that, a practice I began after hostile players in stories I was covering destroyed my first few cameras to keep the pictures inside from being released. But no one in my family knew about it, except for Lucy, the computer literate one, and she was in New York.</span></span></p><p class="P1"><span> Also, if I got beat up and died or went to the hospital, then rather than rushing off to find those did it, my mother might just welcome the greatly diminished long-distance bill.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> In any case, my lie didn't accomplish anything, because one of the four henchmen laughed at me, and the great white hope looked like he'd tuned out at the word 'camera'.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Plan C.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I ran for it.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I didn't make it far, because one of the two thugs behind me, probably using skills he honed as a basketball point guard, got in front of me and knocked me on my ass. I tried to scramble to my feet, but  the other guy behind me grabbed the collar of my shirt and threw me down onto my chest, sprawled on the pavement.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Well, that's it. I'm out of ideas. I'm dead.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Goodbye, world. Sorry we never got along better. All I ask for is the opportunity to float around as a ghost long enough to see Lucy cry at my funeral. I hope she remembers to read that Thomas Gray poem I like.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> While thinking such things, I was unexpectedly saved.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Hey boys. What're you doing over there with him? Come over here."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Through the saggy jean-clad legs of one of my attackers, I could see that computer nerd succubus, who ran off on her own after doing weird things to me, further back on the sidewalk. As creepy as she was, having bribed the registrar's office to get information about me, I wouldn't be surprised if she'd been following me. </span></p><p class="P1"><span> Still, if she wanted to sex all the life from these guys, at this moment, I wasn't about to complain. Though right now, they didn't seem like they'd be interested.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Wait, they seemed completely interested.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> The great white hope had already left. After she took off her glasses, the others left as well, like they'd totally forgotten about beating me up. The great white hope must have a glasses fetish.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span class="T2">        They begin to cluster around her, as they had been clustered around me a second ago, but before </span><span class="T2">they could enclose her, she turned around and sauntered off, her hair trailing out behind her, and I couldn't tell if it was a trick of the setting sun, but it didn't look mousy brown; it looked fiery red. The five thugs fell into line behind her, like a bunch of orphans following their headmistress.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> As she had turned, however, she had shot me a glance and waved her hand in a gesture that couldn't possibly mean anything other than "go away".</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I had every intention of doing so.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> But what a frightening combo attack. Irresistible pheromone attraction paired with death sex. With just a few words those tough gang bangers had been following her around like little ducklings. I understood a little how pointless my cagey attitude towards her had been. If she'd really wanted to suck my life force, then my vigilance couldn't have stopped her, no matter how constant it might be.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> As I boarded a bus towards home, I thought that I really needed to stop walking through the nightlife area after dark. This was the second time in as many days that I'd been in mortal danger coming through here.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> When I got home, I looked around the Internet and made a few calls, looking for any information on a pale ginger-headed street gang leader. It turned out he was fairly well known. His real name was Jared Burns, but on the street, he was known as JZ. He led a cell of about thirty gangsters and had been in county jail twice for drugs and on probation once for illegally carrying a concealed weapon. </span></p><p class="P1"><span> Thirty gangsters. So he could have just sent five guys. Why did he go through the trouble of coming out himself? Did he really want to punch me that badly?</span></p><p class="P1"><span> No, it was probably the money. If Austen had only agreed to pay the ones who actually carried out the attack, JZ would've wanted his piece of it. </span></p><p class="P1"><span> After that, I bugged my sister for a while.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span class="T2">        "So, let me have it. What's your angle this time?" she said immediately, without greeting. "You know, if you go with the von D</span><span class="T3">ä</span><span class="T4">nniken hypothesis, you could just postulate that the Anu-Naki brought a copy of </span><span class="T5">Kanon </span><span class="T4">back to the Elizabethan Age and let Shakespeare play it on their rock-based computer."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> With all the commotion today, I had completely forgotten about working on my notes. "Oh, sorry. I don't have anything for you."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Well, I won't complain. So did you call to have a normal conversation, or did you want to creep me out? I'm game for either tonight."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> She always gets all lovey-dovey when I don't call her for a day or two.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> It's one of her cute points.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Actually, I want to ask your advice," I said.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Is this related to that weird text you sent me the other night, about birth-control pills and cigarettes?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Now that you mention it, it sort of is."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "When you said 'young' girl, how young did you mean? Did you fall in love with one of Mia's classmates?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Even I'm not perverted enough to go after seven-year-olds," I said.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "I wouldn't sound so confident, there are some pretty sexy seven-year-olds out there these days..."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Yeah, but all suffer from the defect of not being you."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Waves of creepification are running down my spine. So, on what matter do you seek advice, young one? The mysteries of puberty? The blossoming of desire? Come on, I can't wait to hear it."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Have you ever heard of Pastor Joseph Austen?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span class="T4">        My sister went silent for a moment. "Yeah. When I worked at the summer camp, he came around a few times. He always gave me a strange feeling, like someday he was going to show up in the </span><span class="T5">20/20 </span><span class="T4">pedophile house. Kind of like you."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span class="T4">        I smiled, both at my sister's unwittingly apt characterization of Joseph Austen and her insult to </span><span class="T4">my person. "I've been investigating him recently for a story about exactly that sort of thing."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Well, I can't say I'm surprised."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "I spoke to one of his victims. She's the young girl I mentioned."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Please don't tell me you were hoping she would fall in love with you and let you take her away from all that."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Nothing like that, but I did sort of feel like I wanted to do something for her."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> My sister's voice disappeared.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> After approximately five seconds, it reappeared.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "You're serious?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "I was surprised myself. But if you'd seen the place she lives in, maybe you'd understand."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "No, I understand the idea of wanting to help someone. It's you understanding it that I don't understand."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> So, in order to enlighten my sister in some small way as to the motives behind this feeling, I told her a little about my visit to the trailer park. But as expected from her, she didn't let herself succumb to emotion and remained objective, saying,</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "I see why you feel that way, and I know I'll sound horrible for saying this, but don't do it. Don't get involved any more with that girl—Amber, was it?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Ah, are you jealous? Don't worry, Lucy, no one will ever replace you."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Stop that! I'm being serious. Hearing about this girl gives me a bad feeling, and I'm not speaking in terms of some abstract intuition. If she grew up somewhere like that and survived, she probably knows how to work people. I'm afraid she was playing you. For all we know, she played Austen, and if that's true, now he's the one being investigated as a child molester and she came out smelling like a rose. So please, try to ignore this awakening of the charitable spirit and spare yourself the danger."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> I waited a few beats. "If you really feel that way, I guess I can't ignore it," I said. "I don't want to make my cute little sister worry, so I'll do as you say."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "For you, that was almost nice."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> After that, we talked for a while about <span class="T1">Fruits Basket </span>and Voltaire, until it was Lucy's bedtime and she had to leave. I felt reinvigorated from talking to her, as if my spirit had been healed.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> Even though I also felt ashamed for what I just did to her.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> I'm sorry, Lucy. I had already made up my mind.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> I just used you to confirm my own opinion.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> I didn't want to face it, so I had you say it for me.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> You and I are too similar, so I knew you'd come to the same conclusion I did.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> Thinking such things, I went to bed.</span></p></body></html>
