It was a large, high-roofed room with wood floors and a stage, at the moment ringed with folding tables, each one covered with aluminum trays heaped high with crab, steak, prime rib, macaroni and cheese, potato salad, grapes and watermelon, and black-eyed peas. Kegs of free beer and carafes of free wine stood on one table alongside jugs of water and bottles of soda. Even more folding tables filled the center of the room, with folding steel chairs pulled up to them.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> The tickets had been thirty-five dollars each, so for the two of us to get in, it had been seventy dollars. I didn't have that kind of money, so it was fortunate that Sophia did. She had given me one Franklin and asked me to handle the details. I had signed us up under the conspicuously false names of Bruce and Naomi Campbell.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Sophia had insisted that we go in disguise, so I was currently wearing a trucker baseball cap that my father kept in the garage for when he wanted to play redneck, a plaid shirt which I had shoved to the back of my closet sometime in middle school and had not unearthed again until now, and the most torn, stained pair of jeans I could find. She was dressed exactly how she usually dressed at school—after all, Austen had only seen her in full succubus form, with red hair and gold eyes, so he was more likely to see through me than her no matter how disguised I was.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> She seemed nervous as we came in, her gaze moving over the tables of food, the people milling around and talking, the high ceiling, and the stage. I directed her to a seat. "Come on, it'll look suspicious if we don't eat," I said.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "What if Austen put the drug in the food?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "I don't think he'd want everyone conking out at different times like that. Besides, if I pass out, you'll protect me from his lascivious fingers, won't you?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> It's not like my family has ever starved, but my mother wasn't much of a cook—limited time and her deficient sense of taste were to blame. After all, she worked, and she was a woman who was perfectly happy to live off the same kind of frozen dinner tray for weeks at a time. So having piles of steak and crab in front of me was sort of a treat, and I wasn't about to pass it up, even if I might get raped after eating it. I grabbed a paper plate and put some of everything on it, dragging along a reluctant Sophia, who would eat steak and grapes but nothing else, saying those two seemed hardest to get drugs into. She also wouldn't drink anything except the water from the drinking fountain outside. On this, I had to agree with her that it was safest to resist, but I couldn't, and had 7-Up, since I didn't want to cloud my wits with wine.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> We had one close call while eating—Austen came around to hobnob with his flock and looked for a moment as if he were going to approach us, but he seemed to decide that he didn't know us and didn't want to, and left to talk to someone else. Even though I wanted the man dead or ruined, I had to admire his social skills; he talked to the attendees, young and old, man and woman, poor and relatively less poor, as if he were genuinely interested in their lives, which he seemed to know quite a lot about in each case. </span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Amber was with him. It seemed he'd promoted her to his secretary at some point; he told this to everyone who asked. Some of them congratulated her, and a few of the older women pinched her cheeks, and one of the younger men pinched her bottom. Even before being pinched on any part of her body, she hadn't seemed happy with all the attention and praise she was getting, and had stood in sullen silence while being made a big deal of.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> As the meal was winding down, Austen took the stage and spoke into the microphone. "Good evening everyone, especially everyone I haven't had a chance to talk to yet. I hope you've all enjoyed your meal. The service will begin in a few minutes, but first I'd like to have everyone drink a toast to our troops over in Iraq and Afghanistan. The staff are passing out special champagne right now, and special sparkling apple juice for the under twenty-ones, and when everyone has a glass, we'll drink."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "This is it," I muttered to Sophia. "The food was fine after all; this drink is going to have it."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "I wonder if there's enough time to get some crab before they finish passing them out," she muttered back.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> There wasn't; church attendants came by our table and served us Rohypnol-laced drinks just a few seconds after that exchange. Amusingly, they put champagne in front of me, but sparkling apple juice in front of Sophia. Of course no one could possibly guess her real age, but to be that far off was embarrassing for everyone involved.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Once everyone had been served, there was a moment of silence, and then,</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Now everyone, a toast: to our troops, and our military families, and our veterans, who protect our freedom," </span></p><p class="Standard"><span> said Austen, raising his own glass and taking a drink.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Everyone except Sophia and me raised a glass and drank, and Austen began the sermon.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> As he spoke, people began to drop off.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> It wasn't simultaneous—it couldn't be—but it was close enough.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Also, anyone who went for the doors to try and get help found them to be locked from the outside.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> And so I found myself in a room full of sleeping people.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Fortunately, the food had been cleared away before the service began, so no one passed out into his potato salad.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Once people started to pass out, Sophia had put her head down on the table as if she were also asleep, and I followed her lead. Austen continued to preach, apparently oblivious to everything going on, until it looked like everyone in the room was unconscious.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Then he turned to Amber, and said, "Now we must get to work."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> With my head down on the table, watching from half-opened eyes, I saw the doors open, and in walked a group of those monkey creatures with stingers that lived in the basement. None was as huge as the Sasquatch Sophia had killed to protect me, but six of the group were at least chimpanzee-sized, and there were three more small Capuchin ones like the one that had sprung from Amber's arms and attacked me, and all of them were grinning those horrible grins full of sharp teeth and staring around with those demented eyes, waving their stinger-tipped tails the way gangsters wave their pieces.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> This was unexpected. I'd thought Austen's aim was to make more of those things, which wouldn't require him to bring in the ones he had.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> It seemed it was unexpected for Austen as well. "Children!" he called. "You should not be here. Soon you will be able to eat well of fresh meat, but for now return to the basement."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I raised my head from the table. Sophia tried to push it back down, but I shook off her hand and stood up.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I had a premonition.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Amber was going to make her move.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Children, listen to your mom—kill him," said Amber.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Calmly.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Casually.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> The nearest chimpanzee jumped onto the stage and swung a giant fist into Austen's stomach. Austen buckled in half.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> The others jumped onto the stage. </span></p><p class="Standard"><span> The six chimpanzees encircled Austen and pounded on him with their huge fists.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> The three Capuchins gnawed at his feet with their sharp teeth.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Austen screamed "No! Stop! Obey me! Children! Listen—you—harlot!" as their huge, hammer-like fists struck him again and again.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> One of the chimpanzees leaned in and bit a chunk of flesh from Austen's shoulder. Blood dribbled down his black shirt and onto the wooden stage. Soon all nine of the creatures were leaning in and biting, tearing hunks of meat from whatever parts of Austen they could reach, dismembering him, eviscerating him, pulling out organs and tissues and tubes, like a horde of children rushing to recover the spoils from a pi<span class="T1">ñ</span><span class="T2">ata.</span></span></p><p class="P1"><span> Now that was a grab feed.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> It took about six minutes for Austen to die. He screamed for every nanosecond of it, ordering the children to stop, cursing Amber, cursing me, trying to tell Amber he slept with her mother, trying to tell the demon children he received oral sex from their mother, insisting that they couldn't do this to him, yelling for someone to help him, whining that it can't end like this, threatening Amber that she'd regret betraying him. After five minutes or so he seemed to break, and started talking dirty, saying things like "Oh yeah baby, oh yeah, that's it, harder baby".</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Then one of the demon children leaned in and bit a chunk out of his neck, removing his ability to speak.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> He died shortly after.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Amber descended from the stage, and the children followed her, leaving a bloody mess of shredded meat and broken bones behind them.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> And at that moment, Sophia stood up and tore her clothes off, revealing her Superman suit underneath.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Actually, she fumbled with her shoelaces, hopped on one leg trying to get her jeans off, and then got her hair stuck on a button taking off her jacket, but within one minute she had stripped down to a sort of backless leotard and a pair of tights, which I assumed was her succubus outfit, because as soon as she had finished, her hair turned red, her eyes turned gold, and wings sprang from her back. </span></p><p class="P1"><span> It was almost cool enough to make up for her totally uncool stripping scene a second ago.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Sophia approached Amber, surrounded by a posse of demon children, as they made their way between two rows of tables.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I decided to sit back and watch from my seat, where it was safe.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Amber," said Sophia.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Who're you?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "My name is Sophia. I'm...a friend of James."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I could tell just from the look on Amber's face that whatever Sophia was planning to say wouldn't leave any impression on her.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Nonetheless, she tried.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I'm sorry for what's happened to you. It must have been frightening. But Austen is dead now, and I really, really think that you should tell someone what he did to you, and try to get help. Someone will help you—even if not your mother, someone will."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Even though I wasn't much better, even I found that speech cheesy. Amber just sneered. "My kids will help me. They'll help me with whatever I want. I was gonna have 'em help me kill half the people in here so everyone else will be scared of me and I can rule this town."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I can't let you do that," Sophia replied. The demon children closed up ranks around Amber, but Sophia still looked calm.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "You're the bitch who killed my firstborn, aren't you? Did that needle-dick friend of yours tell you what I said? I'm gonna kill you for that. I'll fuckin' kill you bitch!"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Amber screamed the last sentence, and with that, the children struck.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> They closed in around Sophia, trying to pound her and bite her, just as they had done to Austen. But Sophia wasn't Austen, and before they could close in, she had taken to the air.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Yes, she flew.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I'd heard that she could, but it was still surprising to see someone do it.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Not to be outdone, one of the demon children jumped after her. Its leg strength was incredible—it could jump thirty feet into the air. It swung a huge fist into Sophia's stomach on the way up, then grabbed her and held on, dragging her down to the ground with it and crashing her body into the floor as it landed. With Sophia on the floor, the others closed in and began stomping and pounding on her. I couldn't see that well, but it seemed that the Capuchins were stinging her, while the others were stinging, stomping, and pounding all at once, stabbing their stingers into her back and legs over and over again. The one who had jumped after her was holding her wrists to the floor, crushing them, twisting them, breaking them, keeping those deadly talons from springing out and shredding them all into ribbons.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> This looked bad.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Sophia could regenerate from injuries, but for how long, and up to how much damage?</span></p><p class="P1"><span> How long could she survive this nine-on-one beating?</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Amber had come to gloat.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "You ain't so tough." She glanced at me. "More bad-ass than a Mossad agent, you said? I don't know what that is, but looks like my kids are even more bad-ass than that."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I got up from my chair, where it was safe.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I looked around, searching for a weapon.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> My chair.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I seized the folding metal chair and, resisting the insane desire to yell "Can you smell what The Rock is cooking?", I ran at Amber, swinging it by its legs straight at her head.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I guess she hadn't expected any danger from me, because she just stared at me stupidly until the chair slammed into her face. I heard something crack, and when I pulled the chair back for another blow, her pretty face had turned into a mess of blood, with her nose as its faucet.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I swung again, hitting Amber in the stomach and flattening her.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I raised the chair again and hit her across the back.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I really did have a purpose for this. I wasn't just beating a sixteen-year-old girl with a folding metal chair to make myself feel strong.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> My purpose came to fruition when I raised the chair to land a fourth blow.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> The demon children, realizing their dear mother was being attacked, had left Sophia to come to her side.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I was probably dead now. Really, this time for real. Even if Sophia could recover from her wounds enough to kill all nine of these things, she probably couldn't do it fast enough to save me. I wouldn't last for six minutes like Austen. I was just a human. One punch from one of those chimpanzees would kill me.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> However, I had only minor regrets. After all, I never thought a useless guy like me would get to die saving half of a roomful of sleeping people from being eaten by demon monkeys. I had always thought I would die meaninglessly in a ditch somewhere, and my corpse would wash down a storm drain like garbage, so getting to go out saving a bunch of people wasn't so bad.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> That's what I honestly thought at that time.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> And that huge fist was only about half a second from crushing my spine.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> But I hadn't known just how fast a succubus could recover.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> And even as I was thinking such things, the fist bearing down on me suddenly detached from the arm driving it.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Then the arm detached from the body.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Then all the pieces of the body detached from each other.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> In a whirling flash of talons, Sophia ran straight into the group of demon children, coming at them from behind. They'd been moving to surround me, and she'd followed them, first cutting to pieces the one about to attack me, then rushing into the thick of things. One, then two, then three, then four of the chimpanzees were cut into shreds, and that succubus, that normally gentle, somewhat airheaded computer nerd succubus, was spinning around like a food processor blade, turning those demon monkeys into demon monkey julienne. The cuts her talons made were so precise that no blood came from them until the pieces hit the ground, where they burst and sprayed fluid everywhere.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Raising my folding metal chair, I saw one of the smaller Capuchins trying to crawl at Sophia and sting her, and I slammed the chair into its back as hard as I could, repeatedly, until it stopped moving. It wasn't dead, but it seemed that even demon Capuchin monkeys had backs which could be broken to stop them from moving.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> In the time it took me to break the Capuchin's back, Sophia had already sliced all six chimpanzees into ribbons and decapitated the other two Capuchins. She stood next to Amber, hunched over in a sea of her beloved demon children's blood, with not a drop on her. Her leotard and tights were as black as they'd been when she clumsily stripped down to them a few minutes ago.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Are you all right, James?" she asked me.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Just to make sure, I hit the broken-backed Capuchin one more time. "I think so."</span></p><p class="P1"><span>  I'd like to think it was the one that stung me.</span></p></body></html>
