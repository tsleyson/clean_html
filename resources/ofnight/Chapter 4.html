Economics was possibly the most boring subject ever conceived of by the human mind. Last night, as I fled in panic from inhuman creatures lurking beyond the veil of reality, I may have been comforted to hear about marginal cost and margarine benefit and Margery's bloomers and Nashville's Equilibrium, which I assumed was the law governing the supply of aspiring country artists and corresponding demand for country music that predicted when acoustic guitar sales would once again skyrocket. It may have reminded me that such boring things existed in this world, things so boring you could just die of boredom, and perhaps the resultant catatonic state would have been enough to calm me down.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> It wasn't that I couldn't understand it, I just wouldn't. </span></p><p class="P1"><span> I refused.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I was a conscientious objector.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> My brain closed the blinds and pretended not to be home the second it heard the word economics.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> When meeting with a counselor to decide your classes for the next semester, you should never flippantly say "I don't care, just give me the minimum number of units in whatever you think is important" and let her pick all your classes, not even looking at what she put down until the day you have to start attending. That's what gets you into classes like economics.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> At first I had thought it was one of those classes that was perennially empty, and she had put me in it just to fill it out and make sure it wasn't canceled. Then I discovered that everybody in the entire college was an economics major.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Also, I had discovered just after the add and drop period had ended that there was another section of the English literature class I was taking with Latrom, taught by someone who was not Latrom. </span></p><p class="P1"><span> Yet another reason why you should never let the counselor pick your classes.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Given the choice between something that was offensive in the eyes of my religion and a few hours in the library, I chose the latter.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I spent the first few hours <span class="T2">re-reading </span><span class="T1">A Critique of Pure Reason</span><span class="T2"> and the next few hours reading </span><span class="T1">Pride and Prejudice</span><span class="T2">, which I had picked up purely because the cover bore a striking resemblance to the cover of </span><span class="T1">Twilight</span><span class="T2">. Out of curiosity, I had tracked down whatever other copies of </span><span class="T1">Pride and Prejudice </span><span class="T2">the library had. There was one with a gangster cover, one with a cover that looked like a Black Sabbath album, one with a cover that looked like the logo of </span><span class="T1">Laugh-In!</span><span class="T2">, one with a cover that looked like a </span><span class="T1">Goosebumps </span><span class="T2">book, and one whose cover was the original theatrical poster from </span><span class="T1">Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope</span><span class="T2">, but with the title replaced by </span><span class="T1">Pride and Prejudice</span><span class="T2">.</span></span></p><p class="P2"><span> I wondered if Amber Linney would pick the book up if she saw the gangster cover. It looked like the spray paint on her wrecked cars.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> I was sitting in a pile of Prides and Prejudices when she approached.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> From behind.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> And laid a hand on my shoulder.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> I nearly had a heart attack.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> I jumped out of my seat.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> And then I managed to play it cool.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> Just play it cool.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> Like three little Fonzies.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> Be wary, but don't let her know that you're being wary.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> Well, it was probably too late for that.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you like that," she said.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Ah, well, don't worry about it. I startle easily," I explained.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "I noticed you weren't in class today."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Of course I wasn't. It's Thursday, Latrom's class is Monday, Wednesday, and Friday."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "No, I mean, we're also in economics and math together...Didn't you notice?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "No, not in the slightest."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> She laughed. "I guess I'm not very memorable."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> It was hard to notice anyone in classes of three hundred students like those; Latrom's only had about thirty, even on exam days. Furthermore, she was going out of her way to look unmemorable. But it was hard to forget about her after last night. It was hard to forget someone who, after twelve minutes and three seconds of sex with a random stranger, had somehow reduced him to a dried-out husk that crumbled into dust, like a corn husk left sitting in the sun for eight years.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Anyway, I thought you might be sick, but I decided to check here anyway, and here you are!"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Yup, here I am."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Do you want to borrow my notes or anything?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "No, if I tried to read someone's notes about economics, my brain would run away to join the circus. I'll just fail, if it's all right with you."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> She laughed again. It was a nice sound. A happy, girlish sound. Like a pony's neigh.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Well, here, at least take my notes for math. We covered permutations and combinations today." She reached into her shoulder bag and took out a notebook labeled "Math 10" in fancy Gothic letters. She sure did have some penmanship. I admired the lettering for a moment before I shook my head.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Oh, you don't want them?" The notebook went back into the bag, and she ran her fingers through her unbrushed hair. "Don't worry, it's not like my notebook will suck the life out of you or anything."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "I had no such concern."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Well, look, James..." She ran her fingers through her hair again, nervously. "I'm sorry, this is really embarrassing...Um, I know you saw me last night."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Huh."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> I guess this wasn't unexpected. After all, I had screwed up and drawn her attention to me, and I assumed that, as a creature of the night, she could see in the dark pretty well, so it wasn't surprising that she'd recognized me.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Being seen by someone, especially you, it's so embarrassing, I could die. So please, give me a chance to explain myself, won't you?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> There was only one way to escape from this situation with my life.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Nothing can explain what I saw last night. Therefore, I have decided it was a hallucination."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> By the way, that wasn't the one way to escape with my life. The one way I could have possibly escaped would have been to deny vociferously having seen anything last night, then move to New York  and support Lucy with a job unloading goods at the docks, working under the name of Carlos Ramirez. </span></p><p class="P2"><span> The girl in front of me took three deep breaths and smiled. "That's right. It was all a hallucination." She ran her fingers through her hair again. "Well, I'll see you around."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> At this point I might have had a chance. That might have been enough for her. Or she might have waited in the parking lot with a sniper rifle to gun me down. Either way, saying,</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "That wasn't a hallucination."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> was not the right thing to do. Adding,</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Tell me what the hell happened."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> was even more wrong. </span></p><p class="P2"><span> And stopping her by grabbing the trailing end of her hair and pulling on it, like some first-grader, was the most wrong thing of all the many wrong things I did in that moment.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> But somehow, she didn't slit my throat and leave me to drown in my own blood. Instead she glanced backward in mild shock that anyone would grab another person's mousy brown, unbrushed hair to stop her from going and said, "Want to eat lunch with me? Otherwise I won't tell you. Oh, I'll pay, so don't worry about money."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> We went to the cafeteria.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> I had never actually eaten here. I usually either brought lunch or starved until I got home. It was so noisy that there was no way anyone could have a decent conversation, and once a food fight broke out, she declared with mild chagrin that there was no way we could talk here, and we brought our food outside to a bench.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> By the way, she actually did buy my lunch. It wasn't cheap, either. For nine dollars each, we got three strips of fried breaded chicken on a dinner roll, a bag of fruit snacks, and a box of juice. Eighteen dollars for this.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> She must be rich.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> Though she still complained, "This isn't much food for nine dollars, is it? I'm sorry, you'll probably still be hungry after eating this. I'll get you anything you like from the grocery store down the street, so please don't be angry."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> As long as I don't catch whatever that country-looking fellow from last night had from eating food that you bought, I won't be angry.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> I was only here to hear her explanation for what happened last night, but she said it was bad manners to talk seriously while eating, and made me wait while she nibbled through her food like a squirrel, stopping every two nibbles to say something about one of the three classes that we had apparently shared for three weeks without my knowledge. I, meanwhile, had bolted down my food in fourteen seconds and took to pacing around the courtyard while she finished, unable to sit still next to an unearthly creature disguised as a good-looking sort of girl, even if doing so would have improved my standing around campus.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> I even saw people staring at us.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> Come on, it's not that weird to stand up and pace around while waiting for someone to finish eating.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> Maybe I was more infamous than I'd thought.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> Or maybe she was well-known.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Are you a celebrity around here?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> I asked, figuring that if I was going to be killed, I was already dead anyway, so impudence was not something to be concerned over. Not that I was ever concerned over it anyway.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> She looked up in mild surprise, a piece of red fruit snack stuck to the corner of her mouth. It was ridiculously moe-moe. I wondered if being moe-moe was some sort of survival mechanism for her. </span></p><p class="P2"><span> When bees find a good source of nectar, they get the attention of the others and fly around in different patterns to indicate whether the source is near or far.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> When rabbits hear the scream of a hawk, they pound their feet on the ground to warn the others inside the den.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> Similarly, acting moe-moe might be a way to lure in country-looking fellows to suck the life out of. </span></p><p class="P2"><span> Though that would actually be closer to the behavior of the angler fish, which dangles a glowing ball at the end of an appendage on its head so that smaller, dumber fish come near, attracted by the light, and are promptly eviscerated by dozens of spear-like teeth.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> In any case, she responded to my question by saying, "No, not particularly. Not so far as I know, anyway. But you know, some people become celebrities without actually knowing it. They say that Walter Cronkite was amazed when he walked into a restaurant and the staff all knew who he was."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> Did they say that?</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "So, I guess it's possible that I became a celebrity without being aware of it."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "In the end, celebrity is something that the celebrators create in their own minds," I commented. "Even if you know you're celebrated, if the celebrators stop celebrating, you can't make it continue just by being aware of it. So in the same way, you can't stop them from celebrating by being unaware of it."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "They also say 'Some are born great, some become great, and others have greatness thrust upon them'. We seem to be discussing the last case."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "They also say 'There are lies, damn dirty lies, and then there are statistics'."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "I've also read that 'It's easy to lie with statistics, but it's easier to lie without them.'"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "But Confucius said, 'A fool lies about the truth, but a wise man lies about his lies.'"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> With that, she smiled, set aside her empty bag of fruit snacks, and said,</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "I'm a succubus."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> as if it were a casual continuation of the meaningless exchange we had just been having.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> And I replied,</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "I thought you were French. Is Succuba somewhere in French Polynesia?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "No, it's not an ethnicity. If it were, shouldn't it be 'Succuban' or 'Succubese'?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Then does it mean you're a member of the church of Succuba?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "That would also be 'Succuban', or maybe 'Succubic'."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "A member of the fourteenth tribe of Israel."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "That would be 'Succubite' or 'Succubine', and what happened to the thirteenth tribe?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Then you're a member of the Succube Party, a new third party in the political system."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "I'm actually an Independent."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Then you're some kind of infinite-dimensional geometric figure with six faces."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "I assure you I only exist in three space dimensions and one time dimension, and this is the only face I have."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Then you're some kind of new bus that sucks its riders into comfortable seats."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Sitting on me is actually pretty uncomfortable. Even my cat won't do it."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Then I give up. What are you—aside from someone with gooey, chewed up fruit snack on her face?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> With a shocked expression, she wiped around her chin with the back of her hand, then suddenly regained her decorum and, drawing a handkerchief from her purse, lightly dabbed her face clean.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "It's still there."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> Deciding to do things properly this time, she walked over to the fountain nearby and looked at her reflection in the water. By the way, calling that pile of dirty old grout with water anemically trickling over it and running into the storm drain a fountain is pretty charitable, but at least it served for a mirror.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> She returned to the bench, red-cheeked and moving in more rodent-like a manner than ever. "Anyway, please stop making this harder than it has to be."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> I loved making things harder for inhuman creatures who were probably planning to kill me.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> She continued.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "I...was once human, but I was transformed into a creature who...who sucks the life out of men with sex."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "How much did that cost?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "It wasn't something I paid for! It wasn't even something I wanted. It was forced on me. It, well, it was during the French Revolution. I was attacked, and became something inhuman. Succubi are sort of like vampires; we eventually die if we don't feed, but we also feel burning hunger and pain if we go too long. But as long as we feed, we don't die—in fact, the amount of lifespan we get from feeding is proportional to how much longer the man we feed upon had to live."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "So you call it 'feeding'? It's just like scarfing down a chalupa to you?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "At this point, that's all it is. Just a shameful, necessary action."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "And your story sure did have a lot of holes in it."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> Well, I won't pry. I don't more than half believe this anyway. If I were an inhuman creature that had to live by arbitrary rules, like a vampire, I would purposely spread around the wrong rules to confuse people and protect myself. Like that corpse with the paper in its pocket saying the Allies weren't attacking at Normandy that the Nazis found floating in the Atlantic.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> And I'd definitely tell everyone that I'd been traumatically forced to become whatever I was, so people would let down their guards and make it easier for me to eat them.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> But those downcast eyes were pretty convincing. And that miserable frown, like a child who's just accidentally pulled off Santa's beard after asking for eight hundred dollars worth of presents. She even somehow made her glasses mist over and took them off to wipe them.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> Well, assuming she wasn't lying about the French Revolution, two hundred and fifty years was a lot of time to become a good actress.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> I could probably take advantage of this.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> If she thought I believed her, she'd be in for a surprise when she tried to show her true colors.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> It had to be convincing, though—I couldn't suddenly do a one-eighty from my previous, suspicious behavior.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Well, I have no better way to explain what I saw last night, so I guess I have to believe you," I said. "So is that why you approached me and said you were tired of Latrom too? Were you trying to suck the life out of me?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "No!"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> She denied it vehemently.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "That definitely wasn't why I approached you—for one thing, I'd never feed on someone from the college. I don't want to be found and killed. Everything I said the other day was the truth."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> Whether or not I believed that everything she had said was the truth, she had just said something I could not possibly ignore.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "If you don't feed on people from the college, what are you doing at this third-rate state college to begin with? Are you here for the nightlife? Then why bother sitting through these ridiculous classes?  Wouldn't you be happier somewhere where they have 'Soul-Sucking 10' and 'Chalupa Seduction 30'?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> She somehow regained her composure. Rather, she probably faked losing her composure, then stopped faking and "regained" it. But either way, she smiled again.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Do I still have fruit snack on my face?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "No, you got it. Are you refusing to answer my question?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Do you mind if I answer using the Socratic Method?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> I didn't particularly care what method she used—she could use the Spicolian Method of answering everything with "Huh?" for all I cared.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Okay. First, tell me why you're at this school."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "It's a long story."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Repay me, for my story."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "You haven't finished your story."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Make a down payment."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> If that was how she wanted to be, I would make sure I told a story that was so personal and so ridiculous that she could never turn it around on me with some callow response like "Yeah, same for me!" as she was surely planning to do.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "It all began in elementary school. I learned to read and write before I entered kindergarten, and everyone thought I was a boy genius and praised me. They were all expecting great things from me in the future. I tried my best to live up to their expectations and did my best in school. Then it happened."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "What?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "I discovered that I was just too smart. I had surpassed even the gods themselves. Pallas Athene descended from Mount Olympus and stole all my books in envy of my intelligence, and I suffered twelve labors and twenty years of misfortune thanks to the wrath of Apollo. Even Odin got in on the act, and threw rotten lox at me from the back of his eight-legged horse, Sleipnir. I thought, what good is this genius which has brought the wrath of the gods upon me? So I started failing everything on purpose."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "I don't more than half believe you," she said, echoing the exact thought I'd had several minutes before.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Whether you believe me or not, each and every word is true."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "There aren't any Greek gods."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Should a succubus be doubting the existence of the Greek gods? At least they have the advantage of having once been believed in by many people. In any case, throughout middle school, I failed everything on purpose. I came up with obnoxious ways to fail everything, like circling the obviously fake answer on a multiple choice exam, or writing that Malcolm X was the son of Crispus Attucks and he was angry that his father was killed in the Boston Massacre on a history exam."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "My parents, likewise doubting that the Greek gods were to blame, thought I was just bored and put me into an expensive private high school. I had enough respect for them to make an effort. For two and a half years I ground away at the college prep curriculum at that school. There were just two problems: I was still cursed by the gods, and the school was a Catholic school."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Why was that a problem?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "I'm not Catholic."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "I'm still not seeing the conflict."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Divinity studies were a required subject, and the teacher was a total fascist—made Latrom look like Abraham Lincoln. If it had just been about reading and remembering the Bible, it might've been all right, but at that school, you learn two versions of every subject: the regular version, and the version according to a literal interpretation of the Bible."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Oh, I see. You clashed with the teacher over creationism and the necessity of witch burning."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "I knew a demonic, inhuman creature would understand."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "But you still made it into college, right?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Well, most of the people from that school made it into Yale or Columbia, and if I'd finished the track I was on, I might have made it too. After all, stupid people are a minority group, so some of us get into the Ivy League through affirmative action. But then they told me they were planning to hold me back a year because I answered a question on ethics that read 'Explain why God chooses to create strife in Muslim countries while Christian nations prosper' with 'Because he can be a real jerk sometimes', I decided I couldn't take it anymore and I asked my parents to switch me to the public high school."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Of course, I was still cursed by the Greek gods, so I went to the public high school and discovered that they didn't much like my kind over there. In fact, they would have preferred a dead opossum for a classmate, because that way they could at least eat it when they got sick of looking at it. So I spent most of my last two years of high school drunk, writing up plans for moving to Sweden so I could marry my little sister."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> She winced.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> She tried to hide it, but I could see it.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> So even demonic beasts have standards.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "In the last two months or so of high school, I discovered that not even Sweden will let you do that, so I devoted myself to finding somewhere our forbidden love could flourish, graduated high school with some miserably low GPA, worked at Best Buy for two years, decided I hated it, worked at Burger King for three months, decided I hated it even more, was nagged by my little sister for a month, decided I hated it slightly less than working at Burger King, and came here, because they would let in some jerk who graduated high school with a 1.9 GPA and then stacked TVs for two years, which nowhere else would."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> I said too much.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> At the very least, I should have left out the part about marrying my sister.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> At least I didn't tell her that that was still an active research project.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> But she didn't look too disgusted. That was a surprise. Such a pathetic life should have been utterly contemptible for someone over two hundred years old. </span></p><p class="P2"><span> In fact, she almost looked satisfied.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Well, you asked why I'm here," she said. "It's basically that."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> How did she still manage to pull that trick on me?</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "There's no way you went through exactly the same thing I did. For one thing, they didn't even have Best Buy in the eighteenth century."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Of course it's not exactly like your story," she said. "But it's similar."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> I came here because I had lots of spare time, and I thought I might as well learn something, she said.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> But why this college.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> At the very least, you should be able to get your PhD in French history and become an expert on the French Revolution.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> So why this college.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Well, let's just say I have my reasons for being in this town, and those reasons won't let me leave it, so it was this college or nothing."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> And why don't you already have a degree, after two hundred and fifty years?</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Women weren't even allowed into universities until the nineteenth century, and even then it was restricted for a long time. Remember Virginia Woolf? They wouldn't even let her walk on the grass."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> Okay, after eighty years.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Actually, I didn't start attending college until the 1950s. My first time I was in the graduating class of 1954 at Illinois State University."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> Okay, after...I quickly did some calculations. After approximately fifty years. I can't do calculations quickly.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Well, I've faked my own death several times and come back as someone else so I could earn another degree. I also spent a lot of time just auditing classes that sounded interesting."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> Why do you need so many degrees.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "It's not as if I major in the same subject every time. My first degree was in French. I chose it because I thought it would be easy."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> I'd think so.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "It wasn't. I hadn't used the language for seventy years. I'd been living in England for most of Victoria's reign. Also, I had to learn all the grammar. It was interesting, though. We read lots of Balzac and Voltaire, and some Rousseau. I read some Descartes on the side."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "In 1968 I graduated with a degree in history. I went all the way to a PhD with that one, so good guess."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> So you like history.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Not particularly. History isn't really history to me. It's more like what was in the newspapers yesterday, only go back seventy thousand yesterdays. I even taught it for a while. It's like when older people talk to younger people about their youth, and about what was different back then. That's how I felt when I taught history."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "In 1977 I graduated with a degree in physics."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> That's a pretty radical change.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Actually, I took my first physics class because I was trying to find out if my immortality would protect me from nuclear fallout. Of course, if all the people died, I'd have no one to feed on, so I'd eventually die anyway. But I was curious, so I took the class and ended up liking the subject somehow."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "In 1989 I graduated with a degree in computer science and electrical engineering. I was starting to feel pretty out of date, especially after the Apple II, so I went for something related to modern technology."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> So you became a computer nerd.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Don't call me a computer nerd. I'm proud to say that almost every single thing I learned with that degree was hopelessly outdated by 1994, and that the only way I could program a computer today would be if it were an IBM with an 8086 processor and a COBOL compiler."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> Even knowing that makes you a computer nerd.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Don't call me a computer nerd, you news nerd."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> So with all those degrees (and possibly others that she forgot about) enumerated, I had only one question to ask her.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "You must have taken the general education courses ten or eleven times by now, so why are you doing it all again? Why are you taking economics, or suffering Latrom's rants?"</span><br/><span> "Actually, I think the more of a demagogue a teacher is, the more interesting he is."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> That's a pretty strange statement. And you just dissed all female teachers.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Because it's fun to see what demagoguery the demagogues are up to. In the 50s it was all about Communism. In the 60s it was all about drugs and nuclear disarmament. In the 70s it was all about free love. In the 80s it was all about stock options and homosexuals. Now it's taxes. It's just fun to watch them—it's like, the subjects change, but the rants stay the same."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> That was truly a statement worthy of an immortal being. Good job, I two-thirds believe you now.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Also, I need a proper course of general education for my degree in biology."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "You're telling me that a creature which defies all biological sense by doing something as absurd as draining the life from men through sex is studying for a degree in biology?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "That was hurtful. Are you calling me a fantastical creature that science cannot explain? How rude. Even after twenty years of marriage, a man can't just call a lady something like that."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> Why did she seem to be enjoying herself?</span></p><p class="P2"><span> Maybe it was the death that awaited me at the end of this pointless conversation.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "I'm sure even I can be explained biologically," she continued. "It's only that no one has ever tried, because no one has ever had a sample."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "So you're planning to experiment on yourself?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "I'm not the only succubus in the world."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "So you're planning to da Vinci another succubus and find out what makes her tick?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "I know someone who would do the actual cutting for me. And I'll stand over his shoulder with a notebook and make drawings, and sometimes I'll scratch my chin and sagely pronounce 'Fascinating. So that's how it works.' while looking as much like Mr. Spock as I can."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> You need pointy ears.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Actually, in my true succubus form, I have them."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> You need to buy a hairbrush.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "You saw me the other night, so you know that I own one."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> You need a Spandex uniform.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "I have one."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> Seriously?</span></p><p class="P2"><span> Anyway, I might have said above that I only had one question to ask her, but actually, that was a lie. There was something else she had said, or rather, it seemed likely she had let it slip, that I couldn't just ignore.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "How did you know that I maintain a news blog?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Ah. Did I say that?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "You did. You said 'Don't call me a computer nerd, you news nerd.' Computer nerd."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "That isn't how my voice sounds!"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> She objected to my impression of her.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Really? I think it was a shocking likeness."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "And you called me a computer nerd again. If you're always like this, no girl will ever love you and you'll never be able to get married."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Can't be helped, I accepted that a long time ago. Besides, as long as I have Lucy, why should I want other girls?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "You can't plan to spend your life with your sister at such a young age! At least search for someone."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "See, you just did it again. You might have been able to infer from my earlier comments that Lucy is my sister, but most people would at least skip a beat while they figured that out. So tell me why you know these things about me when we've only spoken twice, computer nerd. Did you computer nerd your computer nerd into my computer nerd with your computer nerd, computer nerd?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Don't think that just hearing the word 'computer nerd' will affect me when it's not actually directed at me. Only two of those occurrences were directed at me, so I found only those two offensive."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Don't think you can dodge my probing questions and piercing insight forever, computer nerd."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "If I told you I typed your name into Google and found your blog, would you find that creepy?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Yes. Why did you do that?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "It's a secret."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "My sister's name isn't on Google."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "If I told you that I bribed someone in the registration office to give me your info, would you find that creepy?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Anyone would find that creepy. Why did you do that?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "It's a secret."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "When did you do all this?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "When you raised your hand and said 'Here' on the first day of Latrom's class."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Why?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "It's a secret. By the way, if I told you that I broke into your room at night and watched you sleep, would you find that creepy?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Incredibly so!"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Thank goodness I scratched that one off the list, then."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> Again, why did she seem to be enjoying herself?</span></p><p class="P2"><span> Come to think of it, I'd never seen her talking to anyone in class. Not that I'd been watching her particularly closely.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "That's actually why I came to talk to you the other day. I read your blog, and I thought it was good. I did some background research on some of the stories you broke and found out that some major national newspapers picked up that one on the gang problem in small towns."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "I almost died on that one. No <span class="T1">New York</span> <span class="T1">Times </span>reporter would almost die for a story like that, so it was convenient for them."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "And the Sacramento <span class="T1">Bee </span>printed that one you did about bullying."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "That was written from personal experience. I was bullied by four senior girls at the Catholic high school. They tied me down and forced me to do erotic things for them."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "So I was intrigued. I doubt very many people at this college have done anything as amazing as those stories. It seemed like Latrom and the other students should have some respect for you, but they all treated you like the Jew of Malta."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "You could have just said a leper."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "I saw how they treated lepers. They wouldn't have let you sit in the same room with everyone."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Why bring the Jews into this?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> Ignoring my protest against her eighteenth century anti-Semitism, she went on. "From this treatment, I saw two possible conclusions: either none of them had even the slightest idea that you had written those stories, or you were such an egotistical jerk that they couldn't stand you no matter how amazing you were. When you stood up to Latrom that day and stormed out of the classroom, it seemed like the perfect excuse to talk to you and find out."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Don't say I stormed out, that makes it sound like I was throwing a tantrum."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "You were throwing a tantrum."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "I was righteously angry that this college would employ someone with no respect for the integrity of the text."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "And why would that be? Because your respect for John Donne ran so deep? I think it's because you were thinking about how you'd feel if someone did that to your own text, that you risked your life to put together. You were thinking about someone taking your gang story and, say, claiming it supported the idea of martial law in certain low-income neighborhoods."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "I don't have morals like that. Don't do literary analysis on my motives."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> She laughed and flipped back her hair. It was an enchanting gesture. I even thought that being killed by a graceful creature like this might not be so bad. As long as I didn't suffer. I couldn't stand the idea of suffering.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "You know, the first time we talked, I was starting to suspect you might have become an outcast because of option (b). You're doing your best to make it seem that way, anyway. But let me ask: have you ever even hinted to anyone in this school that you run a small local news blog that might be of some interest to someone?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "I yelled it off the roof of the auditorium on the first day of class, but not that many people heard because the campus police dragged me down after about fifteen minutes."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "And what motive could you have for not telling anyone?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "It would be like casting pearls before swine. There you have it, option (b). So now that I know your secret and you know I'm a jerk, please just tell me whether you're planning to kill me. If you're planning to sex me to death, you should know that I'm a pathetic virgin who never even touched a woman's hair until I grabbed yours earlier, so you shouldn't expect too much out of me in that way, though you'll probably get some nice life force from me. If you're planning to slit my throat, would you mind hitting me in the head from behind with a big rock first so I don't feel anything?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "I'm not going to kill you."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Damn, I was looking forward to my first sexual experience, even if I was going to die three seconds later."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "I told you I'd never feed on anyone at the college. It would be too obvious. People would miss you. Your sister would miss you. She would, right?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> She would.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> Even if she wouldn't admit it.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "So, since I won't kill you, I'm pretty much at your mercy. If you want, you can turn me in. There are vigilante groups who hunt my kind. They'd kill me right away, so you could tell them I'm here if you want."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> It was tempting.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Before you decide to take that option, I want you to know that that man from last night was a murderer. He picked up a woman hitchhiking and beat her to death with a hammer. He was bragging about it in the bar. It's why I picked him."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> Her glasses were misting up again.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "I was once human, so I don't want to kill other humans. But I try my best to live well. I try to help others, I try not to get in anyone's way, to be useful. That man didn't. I took his life to continue my own. I think my life is more valuable than his. But if you think that's too great a crime, then I'll submit to your morality and let you turn me in. I won't kill you to protect myself, because you haven't done anything wrong."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> Nice speech.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "By the way, if that wasn't enough to convince you, I can still do things with my mouth and hands without taking any of your life force."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> You suddenly cheapened it at the end.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> But really, all this was too much. Her whole act—the story of being brutally turned into a succubus against her will, her claim of being at my mercy, the downcast eyes, the misting glasses—it was all too much. I was even starting to doubt that she was conning me to later kill me.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> That was dangerous.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> Constant vigilance, as Mad-Eye Moody would say.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> I sat down on the edge of a concrete planter across from the bench where she still sat. staring at me with an entreating look in her eyes. A look that said <span class="T1">Please, I will do anything...</span></span></p><p class="P2"><span> A dangerous look.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> I considered carefully how to proceed.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> The smartest thing to do would be to turn her in, like she said. If these groups that ran around killing succubuses really existed, then I should go straight over there and tell them there was a succubus living in our midst and I had seen her suck the life from a man.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> But, well, even I'm not completely amoral. If she was killed, I might have saved my own hide and my chastity, but I would always be tortured by doubts. Was she really conning me, I would wonder. Could she have been telling the truth. Had I killed a sort of innocent creature of darkness.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> As a reporter, I couldn't stand doubts. I had to know everything.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> So I said this.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "I don't know if I believe everything you've said, but if I were you and I were going to kill me, I would've done it last night, or at least before buying me lunch and talking to me for forty-five minutes. You're clearly something that defies everyday common sense, I saw that for myself last night, and I really can't confirm whether that guy whose life you sucked out deserved it or not, but I don't think you deserve to die. At least, based on what I know so far."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> I might still find myself bleeding out in the parking lot with a sniper rifle bullet in my back.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> But if I did, I would die without any doubts.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> Her face, the face of the creature that called itself Sophia de Nuit, broke into a smile at my words, and her glasses started misting up so badly that she excused herself to the ladies' room to clean them. She came back and flashed me a row of perfect, straight white teeth.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> Her canines were a little long.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> A little fang-like.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "I was considering this last night, after you saw me," she said, the relief in her voice palpable. "And I decided that, if you would show me mercy, I would put myself further into your debt by asking for your help."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> They say bad things always come in threes. I guessed this was the second one.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "I'm willing to do anything I can to repay you, and I can do some things that no human could."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Thanks, but I'm not really interested in the oral sex thing."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> She shook her head and held up her hands palm outward, as if to ward me off. "Oh, no, that was just me trying to save myself. Um, please forget I ever said it, if you can."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Anyway, ask me what you need help with. If I can do it, I'll help. Oh, but you can't live with me. My parents don't even want me there, so I can't start bringing in succubuses and stuff."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "No, nothing like that. I'm trying to find out about someone who lives around here. I think he might be an incubus—the male version of a succubus—and I need more information to confirm. But he's very embedded in the community, and I'm not from around here, so I'm having a hard time getting people to talk to me."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "So you think I might have more luck investigating this guy."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "That's right. Please?" She brought her hands together beseechingly, once again looking ridiculously moe-moe.</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "What's this guy's name?"</span></p><p class="P2"><span> "Joseph Austen. He's a local pastor at the World of Light Church."</span></p><p class="P2"><span> What an incredible coincidence.</span></p></body></html>
