Sophia could protect me, but she would draw attention and possibly bring in extra dangers not sent by Austen. We argued for a while about what to do, but in the end I went in alone and she waited near the entrance in the car, ready to come in if she sensed danger.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I found Amber in her usual LeBaron, this time not cradling her demon child.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> So she was sixteen. I'd thought when I first saw her that she wasn't exactly small for her age, but it seemed she was on the small side after all.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I came up alongside the car and knocked on the window.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Didn't expect to see you here," she said. </span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "I brought your cigarettes, but I didn't think you were serious about the Plan B, since you're so happy with your baby. Or babies, I should say."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "I thought you'd be dead and eaten by now."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "I had a bodyguard even more bad-ass than an ex-Mossad agent, so I managed to make it," I said.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Yeah, your friend killed my firstborn, the one I told you about. Tell that bitch I'll kill her for that."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> The image came to my mind now: Amber, trying to shoot Sophia with a gun held sideways, gangsta-style. Sophia, standing in a hail of bullets, all of them missing. "Say that again when you've killed a few ex-Mossad agents," I said.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Why'd you come here?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Just following up. So, was everything you told me a lie, or just the non-nothing parts?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "I didn't lie to you. All that was true. I just didn't mention some of the stuff that happened in between."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "You lied when you said you wanted to get Austen for touching the kids."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Nah, that was true, but I ain't no sucker. I ain't gonna just tell you everything and let the cops take care of it. I wanna get Austen myself."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "And you're doing a fine job of it. I hear performing frequent oral sex on a man will kill him after seventy to eighty years, depending on how old he was when you started."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Oh, shut up. You're just mad 'cause you aren't the one gettin' it."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "I'm not into ghetto jailbait."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Why'd you come here, anyway? For real."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "To give you one more chance to do the right thing, and come with me to talk to the police."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Amber laughed. "The cops won't believe me. The TV people wouldn't've believed me either. That's 'cause they ain't suckers like you. I saw how you looked at me from the first second. You were hopin' I was some helpless princess who'd make you my knight in shining freakin' armor for 'rescuing' me from Austen, and then give you a blow job as a reward."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Actually, it was the opposite—you were the one who wanted to do me, from the very beginning," I said. "I could tell. I could smell it. You wanted to drag me into the back of that car and ride me. Because you were playing me. Sex was always your weapon—that was how you played people, how you got them to trust you. It felt unfamiliar, trying to play someone without it. But you succeeded, I won't deny it. I wanted to help you. And I still do."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "You wanna help your own self, you mean, to get Austen off your back," said Amber. "Well, you don't gotta worry. In three days, none of us is gonna have to worry about him anymore."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Score.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> In three days, Austen is planning to make some move.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Amber is planning to take advantage of it somehow.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> And she wants me to be there, probably because I'm the only one who knows about her demon children other than Austen and Sophia.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Hence 'accidentally' dropping a hint about when it would take place.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I got away from her with some moralizing blither about saving the children and feeding the starving and turning water into wine and separating the wheat from the chaff, and returned to the car.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> When Sophia asked what I found out, I told her,</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Something so conspicuous that you'll be begging me to let you kill Austen",</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> and then refused to talk about it anymore the rest of the day.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Now I just had to figure out what Austen was planning.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> It was a long shot, but I checked the church website first.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> And there it was.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> The first thing that appeared was a large picture advertising some event. The lettering was all loopy and fancy, as if someone had learned calligraphy by copying the title cards of old Disney movies and had tried to transfer his skills to community service.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> It said "Grab Feed."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> There was a horrible cartoon of a crab in a bib on it, so I assumed it meant "Crab Feed".</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> In any case, this event was taking place three days from now.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> It was a church event. Austen would be officiating, and giving a service afterward.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> In other words, Austen or someone who worked for him had prepared all the food for this event.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> All the food, and all the drinks.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I remembered what Mrs. Robson had said.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "About four months ago, Austen received a huge crate of Rohypnol from somewhere," she had said. "Our PI took pictures of it and showed them to us. They had somehow disappeared, along with him, by the time of our trial."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I remembered what Sophia had said.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "He's quite weak. He even used a gun. I don't think he can do much more than make demon children."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Austen had tried to feed me to his demon children. Had it been Sophia, she would have just treated my neck like a birthday cake and sliced right through it. But Austen tried to feed me to them. That means he wasn't even confident that he could kill me, a weak human. </span></p><p class="Standard"><span> How many demon children had Austen had?</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I hadn't been able to see them, but there were at least five full-grown. I guessed that these were all from Amber, though that wasn't well-supported by evidence.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> According to Mrs. Robson, he had molested around thirty children.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Thirty children could only yield thirty demons.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> And thirty demons was not enough to take over a town, especially when they could be killed so easily. If decapitation could kill them, it seemed likely that enough bullets would also do the job, and this town was lousy with guns.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> But how many people were going to attend this Grab Feed?</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> The next day, on the way to school, I presented her with the evidence.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "So you think that Austen is planning to knock out everyone at the dinner with some date rape drug and knock up as many of them as he can, causing them to give birth to demon children three months later, which Austen can then use as an army to take over the town." </span></p><p class="Standard"><span> She summed it up.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I asked if that was even a tiny bit plausible.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "He's an incubus, so he should have unbelievable stamina, and he can impregnate men or women, so he doesn't need to care which gender shows up," I said. "And he ordered a crate of Rohypnol. A crate. If he just wanted to rape a few people, he'd only need a few bottles, but he ordered an entire crate."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "I don't know..."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Austen's been a pastor in this town for almost ten years. He must have come here specifically because he wanted to build up an army. He chose to be a pastor so people would trust him, knowing that this is a pretty religious town where most people wouldn't believe that the pastor was doing their kids or fraternizing with prostitutes. He probably targeted the children because there were a lot of them, they were easy to get into bed, and they weren't likely to tell anyone they'd given birth to a Satan spawn. Like Mrs. Sullivan said, kids can be cruel to anyone who's different."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Then why try something big now?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span>  "It's too slow. If he makes the after-school program into an orgy, he runs the risk of one of the kids snitching, so he has to go after them when they're alone, and he can't get every kid in the program or someone is going to connect the dots, so he has to do them one or two at a time. Then he has to wait three months for the incubation, and then he has to gamble that the parents don't kill the thing the second it pops out. At first he was only targeting girls so it wouldn't look suspicious if they got pregnant—after all, even very young girls can sometimes get pregnant. But he got desperate and started going after the boys too, and going after too many kids at once, and that's where he slipped up."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "And what about all those women he was seeing?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "According to what Mrs. Robson said, they were mostly hookers and barflies, so they probably got abortions the second they suspected they were pregnant. I doubt Austen realized any recruitment gain from them."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "And in this theory, what is Austen going to do after the Grab Feed?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I had told her that was what it was called.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I couldn't help smiling.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> She looked a bit miffed, but continued. "Wouldn't he realize that everyone will suspect he had something to do with it, when each of them—man and woman, young and old—suddenly becomes pregnant after passing out at this Grab Feed?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Most of the people are probably members of his church," I said. "They'd have a mental block against thinking anything bad about him. Sure, they'd probably lose some of their trust in him, but the situation would be so confusing that I doubt they'd immediately blame it on him. It wouldn't be like with Richie Robson, who was conscious when Austen did it. He's probably planning to lay low and let the confusion and fear keep the lynch mob away from his door."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Or he's planning to lead the lynch mob," Sophia suggested. "To make them do what he wants, rather than an army of demon children."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Either way, he's conspicuously exposing the supernatural to a large number of people," I said.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> She nodded.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "You're right. I have to investigate this, at least."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> By the way, the cigarettes I had given Amber weren't the little feminine Virginia Slims; they were big, nasty Camel Wides with extra tar and cyanide, perfect for the three pack a day smoker who can't be bothered to smoke three packs anymore to get a nicotine fix.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I figured she could trade them with the people here more easily.</span></p></body></html>
