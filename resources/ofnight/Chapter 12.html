Who knew what had happened to the ones born by C-section from the boys or the ones born from all those girls Austen had abused over his ten years of army-building, but the parents must have gotten rid of them somehow, and good riddance.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Once Amber had recovered a bit from my chair attack, she'd started screaming that she was going to call the cops on us and have us locked up for murder. By this time, Sophia had put her clothes back on and once again looked harmless and mousy, so I returned the sneer Amber had given me and said,</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Try it. See if the police will take the word of a trailer park strumpet who rented herself out to an incubus as a demon factory that a fine, upstanding young college student like this here girl"--and here I gestured towards Sophia as if I were Vanna White showing off the new Camaro you would win for making it to the final round--"murdered the local pastor when there's no apparent motive and neither hide nor hair of a murder weapon",</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> causing Amber to shoot me a dirty look. I felt a little bad for taking so many cheap shots at her—with both my words and the folding metal chair—but she tried to kill my friend, so I felt we were even.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Of course, for the very same reasons the police would never believe we'd murdered those people, we could hardly hand Amber over to the police; there was no evidence that she'd killed Austen or those church workers, and without the extra assumption of the demon children, it seemed highly unlikely that she'd be able to kill an adult man in the way those men had been killed. As unsatisfying as it was, Amber was getting out of this scot-free too.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> As a final insult, Sophia had tried to comfort Amber as she sat in the pile of blood and monkey parts, placing a hand on her shoulder and saying,</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "I'm sorry. They were demons, and they were Austen's, but they were your babies, and I know that. I didn't want to hurt you like this, but I couldn't allow them to kill any of these people. I hope that you understand why what you did and what you were planning to do were wrong",</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> as if she were speaking to a five-year-old who had hit her friend over a toy and gotten a time-out. </span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Amber seemed to somehow understand the role she was playing, because she just screamed "I hate you, bitch!" and broken down into tears, and Sophia had looked at me for help, genuinely puzzled by the failure of her preschool teacher techniques.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> That's exactly why I don't go for jailbait.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> They may have the bodies of sexy women, but they have the minds of spoiled children.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> While Amber bawled like a baby, I had filled some large Ziploc bags with leftover food to bring home with me. No point in letting it go to waste.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Then we left.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> When we pulled into the driveway of my house, I said, "Listen, I kind of owe you, so don't get the wrong idea here, but if you're too tired to drive home, you could probably sleep in my room. I'll go in the living room."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> She refused, but added, with a smile, "That's nice of you" and petted me on the head like a cat again.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> The next morning.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> The first thing I did was check the morning news broadcast. Sure enough, the bloody massacre at the Grab Feed was all over the headlines. It seemed that after everyone had woken up, someone had mentioned to the police that Amber was gone, and they'd gone and picked her up as a person of interest, so she was in custody now. Some of the people who were there had managed to convince themselves that there had been a drive-by shooting, so Austen was being memorialized as the tragic victim of gang violence, even though just looking at his corpse would show that no Tek-9 had done that.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> The second thing I did was pick up the phone.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Hello, Sullivan Residence," June Sullivan answered.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "June, this is James Moran."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I expected her to hang up right away, but she didn't.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> However, she did say "What can I do for you?" a bit stiffly, as if I were an annoying telemarketer.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I guess that's about the best treatment I could hope for.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I asked if she'd heard about what happened to Austen. </span></p><p class="Standard"><span> She had.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I asked if her son had been pregnant.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> He had.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I told her about Wenjing Robson.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "I'm asking you, begging you to go to the police about what happened to your son, for Mrs. Robson's sake. Austen destroyed many lives and killed many people, but if you come forward, you can help fix some of that. You can help get Mrs. Robson out of the mental hospital and back to her son. Please, consider it."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> For a second I thought she'd hung up on me, but then she spoke again. "You know, I was hitting on you when you were here."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Gee, I hadn't noticed.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "I have this fantasy."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I don't think I want to hear about this.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Where a pure young boy—a Mormon missionary, or a Boy Scout troop leader, something like that—comes to my house. I thought you were a pure young boy. But you're a filthy adult, just like the rest of us."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I'm honored.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> After that, she hung up.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> But I heard six weeks later that Wenjing Robson's case had come up for appeal and she'd managed to get herself released from the mental hospital, and was working on getting her son back, so in the end it seems Mrs. Sullivan was able to separate her feelings about the request from her feelings about the requester.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> For some reason, my mother and sisters had the day off. It was probably some minor holiday like Boxing Day or something, but the college didn't observe it so I hadn't expected them all to be there when I came down. When I saw them gathered around the table having a late breakfast, I decided that I was going to celebrate Boxing Day too.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> That lasted until a navy blue Audi pulled into the driveway.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Who is that?" my mother asked as Sophia got out of the car, once again dressed in a stylish jacket and sunglasses.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "That must be James's girlfriend," said Sue. "The one I told you about. The computer nerd."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "How nice of her to drive all the way here to pick you up. She must like you a lot. Make sure she never finds out what your personality is like, okay?" said my mother.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "She isn't my girlfriend, and should a mother be saying things like that to her son? Anyway, I'm taking the day off, so tell her to go away."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "I am not telling that poor girl to leave after she came here to pick you up," said my mother. "Get upstairs and get dressed right now, and I'll go tell her that it'll be a few minutes."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I grudgingly obeyed, going upstairs to change out of my pajamas, and watched from my window as my mother went out to speak to Sophia. Damn that computer nerd succubus. I had been trying to keep her away from my family, but she'd managed to meet them anyway. I imagined the conversation they were probably having down there.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Sorry for my idiot son troubling you so often," my mother was probably saying.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Oh no, <span class="T2">it's no trouble at all," Sophia was probably replying. "Someday, when I drain all his life force and extend my own existence for another few decades, it will all become worth it."</span></span></p><p class="P1"><span> But still, I felt a little bad.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> That's why, once my mother had forced me to get in her car and be driven to school, I said the following:</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I should apologize to you, I guess."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "For what?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "You're right, I guess I should make clear which of my many transgressions I'm apologizing for.  You see...running around this town, reporting on things, I've seen a lot of deception."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Living for two hundred years, I've also seen a lot of deception."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Then you know that people who are as good as their word are rare, right?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "No, I've met a few people who said they were going to rape and kill me, and they did their best to do it."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Wouldn't that be more like being as bad as their word?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "It depends on whether 'as good as your word' means 'doing exactly what you say' or 'carrying through the moral implications of what you say', and I took the meaning as the former."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Then I'll rephrase—you know that people who say they'll do something good and then actually do it are rare, right?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Yes."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "And you know that people who say they'll do something good and then don't do it are common, right?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Yes."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Did you also know that Greenland is owned by Denmark?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "I did."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "And Guam is a protectorate of the US?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "I knew that."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "And Libya was once an Italian colony?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "I remember it."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "And the British Virgin Isles are British?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "I never would have thought otherwise."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "And the Vatican is its own country?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "One of the richest in the world."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "I didn't actually know any of that, so I was confirming with you that what I had heard was true."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> She looked happy. </span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I had noticed before that she looked happy when we were carrying on sustained pointless blather like this, but I had thought it was some sort of act or pose so she could suck out my life force.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> It wasn't. </span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I remembered how bored, how sad, how uninterested she had looked when walking with the country-looking fellow into the park that would be the last thing he ever saw.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> She wasn't that good of an actress.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> She was genuinely happy.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> That's why I felt guilty, and said this:</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "You're rare."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Because I'm a succubus?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Because you were as good as—no, better than your word. You said you wouldn't hurt me, and you haven't. More than that, you saved me."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> That's right. I wouldn't be here if not for her.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I wouldn't have school to skip if not for her.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I wouldn't have a sister to love if not for her.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I wouldn't have a mother to complain about me if not for her.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I wouldn't have a mouth to eat with, or fingers to type with, or a tongue to speak with, or a mind to think with, if not for her.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> She saved my life.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "But even though you turned out to be a good person, I was suspicious of you. Even you must know that girls don't really go for guys like me, so when you first talked to me, I thought you were setting me up for a humiliation. That's why I followed you and found out what you really are. Then it turned out you were the good one, and the one who was playing me was Amber, who I never suspected. So I'm sorry I misjudged you so badly."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I couldn't say such embarrassing things while looking at her, so I had been looking out the window of the car as trees and fields sped by. That's why I didn't notice it right away when she didn't reply.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Are you...crying?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "No," she insisted.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> She was totally crying.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "I'm the one who wants to cry! I almost died twice in the past week, then I had to admit my own worthlessness as a reporter, <span class="T1">and </span><span class="T2">say embarrassing things to you, of all people! What have you got to cry about? Did I say something thoughtless? I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry for everything. Just throw me out of the car right here."</span></span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I'm not crying," she insisted, sniffling.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Then you need to put your glasses back on, because your driving is getting pretty erratic here."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> She pulled over the car next to the freeway, and we sat there for a few minutes while she cried, insisting every time I brought it up that she wasn't crying.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Since she's attractive, you might have thought she would cry daintily—a few tears on her cheeks, a few feminine moans. Nothing of the sort. She cried with her whole face scrunched up, her eyes red, her face covered in a mixture of tears and snot. I dug in the glove compartment and, finding a few napkins, offered them to her.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I'm not crying," she insisted, turning her face away from me and wiping it with the napkins.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> When she was done not crying, she started the car and got back on the freeway. We traveled along in silence for a while. Then she said</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I haven't had anyone say anything that embarrassing to me in decades. The emotion overtook me. I'm sorry."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "So you admit that you were crying."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I'll never admit to that."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> She's really not a good actress. It's no wonder she failed her audition to become the new Elizabeth Taylor.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Also, it seems she's surprisingly weak against emotional stuff.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Anyway, it seems I'm going to be here for a while," she continued. "If you feel grateful to me, you could repay me by helping me out with future investigations."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Future investigations.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> So there were more freaky creatures like her and Austen living in this town, waiting to kill me.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I look forward to working with you, James."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I look backward to not working with you, Sophia."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> But she looked happy even as I said this, and I thought that if a worthless piece of garbage like me could make a cute girl smile, maybe that wasn't so bad.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Even if the cute girl was a two hundred-year-old infernal creature who seduced men so she could steal their life force.</span></p></body></html>
