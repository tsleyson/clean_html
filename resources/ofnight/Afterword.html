Failures are all different. Some failures failed because they had no talent, others because they had no ambition, others because they had no drive, or did not persevere, and some failed because they had no help, or their help wasn't helpful enough, or wasn't the right kind of help. On the other hand, some failures fail because they had too much talent, or too much ambition, or too much drive, or too much perseverance, or too much help. There are even people who, to an outside observer, may seem to have succeeded, but in actuality have failed, simply because they believe themselves to have failed.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Thus far, I have been a failure as a writer.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> The first time, I failed because I had no talent.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> The second time, I failed because I had no ambition.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> The third time, I failed because I had no talent and no help, but too much ambition, drive, and perseverance.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> There were many smaller failures in between.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> This book may also be a failure. If so, it will fail in a way that no one could have foreseen, and that's the fascinating thing about failures, making them much more interesting for those who do nothing but watch and criticize. </span></p><p class="Standard"><span> But in one way, it has succeeded over most of my other work: it exists. Many of the others, first and foremost, failed at existing.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> After ten years of work, ten years of misguided efforts, ten years of wasted hours and broken keyboards, I finished something.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> It may be worthless. It may be the worst thing ever written, even if one considers the works of Hiro Mashima as literature. It may be a failure. Maybe I had no talent, or no drive, or no ambition. Maybe I lacked help. Maybe, conversely, I surfeited. But here it is.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Something you can call a finished book.</span></p></body></html>
