I had half expected her to be there already when I arrived, but when she wasn't, I didn't think it could be long before she appeared.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I waited four hours.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> When she appeared, her chaotic mousy brown hair dammed up behind a white headband, an uncute denim Mennonite skirt around her waist and a plain white blouse around her shoulders, I asked where she had been, and she, in a tone of surprise, said she was in class. I wanted to shake her and ask why she spent four hours going to hear Latrom give his idiotic views on poetry whose writers she had been alive to meet, but I now knew how easily she could kill me, so I asked why she spent four hours going to hear Latrom's idiotic views on poetry whose writers she had been alive to meet without shaking her.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Don't get angry," she said. "I was expecting you to come to class. I was going to speak with you there."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> ...It seemed we had misunderstood each other in a particularly stupid fashion.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Well, now that you are here, what have you got to say for yourself, you first kiss-stealing computer nerd succubus?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Why should I say anything for myself? You're the one who was nearly beaten and needed to be rescued, then ran away before I could come back to talk to you. Why don't you say something for yourself?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> ...She was right.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Being rescued by your sister is one thing, but when the rescuer is an infernal creature whose acquaintance you've only just recently made, the proper etiquette must be used.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> But first,</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "What do you mean, ran away before you could come back? I thought you were signaling me to run away!"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "I meant, run away to somewhere safe and wait for me."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "How am I supposed to know that?!"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> She looked thoughtful. "I was sure I had imprinted my scent pattern on you. You really didn't get my meaning at all? That's strange, it should have worked. Well, I've never done it before, so I guess I need some practice."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Is that why you attacked me and stole my sacred first kiss that I was saving for Lucy?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "That was one reason."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "You're terrible! How do you live with yourself? Rather, how am I supposed to live with you, knowing you have mind control and death sex powers?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I hadn't expected to be so angry. My intention had been to exchange information with her and then leave, but somehow I was experiencing a delayed panic from the incident last night—because I had almost been beaten up, but also because succubuses were damn scary--and now I was taking it out on her.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> She seemed to understand somehow, because she said this:</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "I'm sorry. I know you were almost attacked last night, and I know being around someone like me takes a little adjustment, but please don't be angry anymore. I know seeing someone using inhuman abilities can be off-putting, but they came in handy last night, didn't they?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> ...She was right.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "...Thank you," I said grudgingly.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "You are most welcome, O'Neill."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Are you Jaffa now too? A Jaffa succubus? Is that headband hiding a gold-infused tattoo?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Actually, I'm not wearing anything under this headband."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "...Is that supposed to be sexy?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Some men find a bare head quite erotic."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Most of them are Amish."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "By the way, you say that I was alive to meet the poets we're reading, but it's not as if I actually met them. They were like celebrities. Meeting someone like Percy Shelley or Lord Byron would have been like meeting Charles Bronson today."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Did you actually just use Charles Bronson as an example?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "He's not popular anymore, is he?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Not particularly."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Celebrities go in and out of fashion so quickly ever since mass media, I have trouble keeping up with them. In my lifetime, I've probably forgotten more celebrities than even Joan Rivers knows."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "So you know of Joan Rivers, but you couldn't think of any actor more recent than Charles Bronson."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "It's actually pretty depressing when you think about it. I've had four lifetimes' worth of life, and I've still never managed to become a star. I remember when I saw <span class="T1">Cleopatra</span><span class="T2">, I wanted to be just like Elizabeth Taylor, but they didn't have color contacts back then, so I figured out how to use my powers to turn my eyes violet. But when I went in to audition, they told me I couldn't act."</span></span></p><p class="P1"><span> "You're surprisingly easy to influence, aren't you."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Somehow I always end up blathering when I'm with this girl. I think she makes it happen on purpose.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Anyway, enough of that. What happened to those guys last night? Did you kill them all with sex?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "No! I may have sex to feed, but I would never do it with five men in a row, like some assembly line!"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Actually, the image I had was more of a gang bang..."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Though to her it would be more like a dessert buffet.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I led them into an alley and left them there."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "How did you get away? They were all twitterpated and following you around."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I ran."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Huh."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Somehow I had expected a more succubus-like answer. One that involved more use of infernal powers. One not so mundane.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "More importantly, who were they?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "You didn't hear?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "It's not as if I arrived and then stood around listening, waiting for them to start hitting you."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I told her what I had discovered last night about JZ and his gang. "They'd been paid by Austen to threaten me and make me stop investigating," I finished.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "That girl Amber must have told him, don't you think? Or do you suspect the housewife?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> No, I didn't suspect Mrs. Sullivan.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I knew it was Amber.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> That was why I had called Lucy last night and told her what was going on.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Because I wanted to see Amber as a victim, I hadn't wanted to face the facts.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I didn't want to believe that she had betrayed me like that.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Betrayed...that word implied some level of trust existed, but honestly, there hadn't been any. I hadn't trusted Amber, and I doubted she had trusted me. </span></p><p class="P1"><span> So this wasn't really a betrayal.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> It was a reversal of expectations.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> And I had needed to hear someone else tell me that such a reversal of expectations was not only possible, but likely, when dealing with someone like Amber who had led a life where trust was a liability.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "What will you do?" Sophia asked me.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Those guys weren't just going to bother you with leaflets. They were serious. You might have died, she said. Maybe you should consider giving up the investigation. Just disappear from Austen's radar.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I would like to. I've been a worthless son, a worthless brother, a bother to everyone. I don't want to make anyone sad if something happens to me. I would like to give up.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> But I have doubts.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> That's why I went to Harrington Hills, to see Amber again.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> When I told this to Sophia, that computer nerd succubus grinned at me with those satanic first kiss-stealing lips and said "Well, do your best and try not to get hurt. I'm really cheering for you, you know. Watching and talking to you has been the most fun thing I've done in almost eight years."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Apparently I was entertaining for her.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I had spent my whole life as an ostracized weirdo, so as strange as it sounds, I was sort of flattered to find that I was someone who was fun to be around by succubus standards.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> It was like spending your whole life as the most hideous duck in the pond, so ugly that other ducks shudder when they look at you, only to discover that in vulture world you were Jude Law.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> And so I left the school, and headed for Harrington Hills, with the notion that I was the Jude Law (or maybe more like the Jack Black) of succubuses to buoy my spirit and make me feel that life was worth living. </span></p><p class="P1"><span> This time, I didn't bother talking to any of the people lying in the mud near the front, but instead headed straight for the car graveyard at the back of Harrington Hills to look for Amber.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> And I found her, in the same car she'd been in last time.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Holding a bundle of white blankets.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Cradling it.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I knocked on the window.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Oh, it's you," said Amber. She didn't seem surprised to see me.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Austen sent some guys after me last night to teach me not to get involved with his 'bidness'. I don't know how he found out who I am so quickly, but there's only one way he could've known to look."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "You think I told him?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I do."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I did."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I know."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> We stared at each other for a second through the open door of the rusted hulk. I looked over her pretty blue eyes, her fair hair, the attractive curve of her lips. It was such a shame. She shouldn't be here, Austen's plaything. She should be in the suburbs having brainless fun with her friends, looking forward to a bright future, like my sister Sue. </span></p><p class="P1"><span> Sorry, Lucy. I know what I said, but I can't leave it alone. I have to try one more time.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I'm not angry."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I'd be angry if somebody stabbed me in the back. But you aren't like me. You were brought up right, huh? A rich little kid from the 'burbs."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I don't blame you."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I don't care who you wanna blame."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Has Austen told you what he is?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Amber shifted the bundle of blankets in her arms. "I figured it out he ain't human."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I know he didn't force you. You said you gave birth to some sort of monster. If he'd forced you, you would've become like him. But since you were willing, you had the child. From that, I know he didn't force you, and I know he's the only person who ever took care of you, and I know I'm just a stranger who showed up one day, so I understand why you told him. But if you don't like what he's doing—if you don't like it even a little, even if you're fine with it but you don't like what he's doing to the other children, then come with me to the police station. I know some people in the police department. We can make sure he never does what you don't like again, and we can make sure you're protected."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Amber didn't answer. She looked away, down at the bundle, and swayed it a little.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I couldn't say whether I was getting through to her.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I doubted it.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> But I had to try.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "What's in the bundle?" I asked, already knowing the answer.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "After I left that creature in one of the cars, I went home. I was fine for a while, until I just started crying for no reason. Then I went back for him. After all, he was my baby. My firstborn baby."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I made a little nursery for him in the back of a minivan. He nursed for about three days, so much that my nipples hurt. He could walk after a week, and he wouldn't nurse anymore. He wanted raw meat. Austen made sure he got it. Austen made him a nice little room in the church after he found out. But I can go see him whenever I want to. Because he's my baby."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> It happened too fast.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> The bundle of white blankets burst open, and I found myself staring at the monkey-like face of what had been inside. It grinned at me with rows of sharp teeth poking through its lips, its pallid grey skin covered in a thin layer of wiry black hair.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> And it had a tail.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I found that out later, by the way. It had a long, monkey-like tail with a very not monkey-like stinger at the end. I didn't have a chance to find out, because it sprang at me, grabbed onto my shirt, and stuck the stinger between my ribs before I react.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> My head was swimming.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> My side was throbbing.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I wanted to throw up.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> The monkey-like creature dropped away from me and scurried back to Amber. I stumbled away, dimly aware that I had fallen into a trap.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Sorry, Lucy. You were right, as usual.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Sorry again.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> That's what I thought as I passed into unconsciousness.</span></p></body></html>
