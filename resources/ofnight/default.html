        <p class="standard"><span>I was suspicious.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>After all, I'm not blind to how I'm seen around that campus. The crazy loser with no friends, who runs around town chasing rumors and gossip and can't stop challenging everyone's favorite English literature teacher, is not a popular guy. That's why I was suspicious. It's unusual for anyone, especially a girl, especially a reasonably good-looking sort of girl like her, to go out of her way to talk to the crazy loser with no friends and tell him she agrees with his interpretation of a piece of literature. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>It's unusual for anyone.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I'd be suspicious of anyone.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>But, well, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't extra suspicious because she was a reasonably good-looking sort of girl.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I couldn't even imagine what she might be trying to get out of me with her feminine wiles, but I'd determined that I wouldn't let it work. I might make a fool of myself constantly, but still, no one was going to make a fool of me.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>That's why, when I saw her coming out of that bar on the other side of the road, I followed her.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>After all, I'm a reporter (after a fashion). Gathering information is what I do. And if someone's trying to manipulate me, I'd like to know a little more about them.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>That's why, when I saw a reasonably good-looking sort of girl who I suspected of trying to use feminine wiles on me coming out of a scummy dive bar on the other side of the road, accompanied by the sort of man who hangs out in scummy dive bars, I followed her.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I followed her, that girl who didn't look like she belonged in a scummy dive bar, and the man who did look like he belonged in one, through the warm early summer evening. l followed them through the well-lit main streets of the nightlife area of Santa Robles, an area I had come through only because it completely encircled the college, like a wall protecting the students from staying home and studying. Back towards the college, towards the small park on the edge of campus. Past a sign that read "Closes at sundown". </span></p><p class="standard"><span>She wasn't smiling.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She wasn't laughing.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>In fact, she looked like she was headed to a funeral.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The man was smiling.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The man was laughing. Mostly at his own jokes.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I noticed how he kept a tight hold on her arm the whole time, as if he expected her to try and run away. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>I followed them to a picnic table, by now pretty sure what was about to happen. I thought about leaving. I thought about whether staying would make me a pervert. I thought about my night-vision camera, at home in my desk drawer. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>If she was planning to manipulate me, this was enough to destroy her. College students are fundamentally high school students on an ego trip. Just the rumor that this girl was the sort who would take a redneck in his forties from a dive bar into the park and let him do whatever he wanted would be enough to destroy her reputation. A few pictures could really seal the deal.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I wondered if there was enough starlight for my camera to capture anything.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>As it turned out, what she said to me in the library that day was one of the only things she didn't lie about. Or at least, lie by omission about.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She submitted herself with a "Please be gentle, it's my first time," and the whole process began. It took him about twelve minutes to finish. Twelve minutes, that's not bad. At least he had some stamina.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Then he died screaming.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It took him twelve minutes to finish having his way with the girl. It took him three seconds to finish becoming a corpse. I panicked.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I took a picture.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>When she saw the flash, she looked up. I took another one, and turned around, running through the bushes as fast as I could, just wanting to get out of there, just wanting to reach the light of the nightlife district, just wanting to get home.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>You may not believe this, coming from the sort of pervert who would stay and watch that, but I spent most of the time focusing on her face. I wanted to see what her mindset was, what sort of expression a reasonably good-looking girl makes while submitting her body to a total stranger on a picnic table in a park.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She looked bored.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Bored, and a little sad.</span></p>

        <p class="standard"><span>I love my little sister.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I'm not ashamed to say it.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Throughout our lives, we had no one to depend on but each other, no one else to turn to when our parents were too busy with their own lives.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I wish that were true. It has a nice Dickensian sound to it.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The truth is, I don't remember when or why it started, but by the time I was ten years old, my four-years-younger little sister was the most important person to me in the world.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>That's why when she finished middle school and then announced that she wanted to go to Something or Other Prestigious Academy of the Arts for high school, and my parents told her she was too young to go to New York and there were schools of the arts here in California that she could attend, I agreed with them.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>But my sister has a stubborn side, and she went off and found a job teaching martial arts to little kids over the summer and saved up enough money for a plane ticket. She also called our uncle who conveniently lives in New York and asked if she could stay with him, and he said yes.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Our parents weren't happy. They told me to talk some sense into her.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I tried.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I begged.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I groveled.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I sniveled.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I even cried.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I'm not ashamed to say it.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>In the end, in order to win my approval and make me stop crying, she made a deal with me. If I didn't oppose her decision, she would make sure that every evening, around six, she would be near the phone and ready to talk. I haggled with her, trying to get morning, brunch, noon, and evening, with an option on late night, but in the end we settled on morning and evening, and with that she managed to suppress the most vehement opposition figure and win her way.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It was morning.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I was regaling her with my latest insightful analysis of a great work of literature.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Olivia is an oniichanko," I said as I spread jam on bread. "She goes into deep mourning after the death of her oniichan, and refuses to receive anyone, including Count Orsino. Orsino obviously didn't watch enough <span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1">Sister Princess</span><span class="T2">, because he doesn't understand just how precious the oniichan-imouto relationship is. And Malvolio thinks he can swoop in and replace Olivia's oniichan, but he's lacking the vital ingredient of blood. No, the only one who can replace Olivia's oniichan is another woman, Viola, also an oniichanko, but now in disguise as a man and in love with Orsino herself."</span></span></p><p class="standard"><span class="T2">"So your contention is that the entire plot of </span><span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1">Twelfth Night </span><span class="T2">is driven by woniichan moe," came Lucy's voice from the other end of the phone.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>There's only one person I can talk like this with.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>If I had lost this for nine months of the year, I think I'd be comatose from a diphenhydramine overdose by now. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>And with Lucy's high school graduation coming this spring, I'll soon have her back year-round.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Yes, with a hint of yuri. Look at the evidence!"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"You sound like Erich von Dänniken. 'Look at the evidence! Primitive man could never have created and deployed such advanced rock-based technology on his own! Clearly, all this was the work of ancient aliens!'" Lucy mocked in a rather terrible German accent.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"So you're not convinced."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I'm convinced that you're convinced. But you know, James, nothing is going to convince me that Shakespeare purposely wrote his plays taking account of moe. Mostly 'cause it wasn't invented for another four hundred years."</span></p><p class="standard"><span class="T2">"What Shakespeare did or didn't take account of is meaningless," I said. "His plays outlived him </span><span class="T2">and adapted themselves to the era in which they were read. Look at the backlash against Cordelia's </span><span class="T2">death in the 18</span><span class="T3">th</span><span class="T2">Century. Look at the bloodthirsty acceptance of Cordelia's death in the mid-20</span><span class="T3">th</span><span class="T2">Century."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"That's fine, but that's a reaction, not an interpretation," said my sister. "People are free to react however they want, but I think it's a mistake to go too far afield in our interpretations. Otherwise—"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Wait, say that again."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Say what?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"What you just said."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Um, people are free to react however they want, but I think it's a mistake to go too far afield in our interpretations. Otherwise—"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I shuddered. "Hearing a woman talk smart is too nice. I love you, Sis."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Shut it with all that creepy talk! Go find some friends, or a girlfriend, or a bosom buddy, or a friend with benefits, or a sex friend, or a call girl of whom to be a regular client, and stop creeping me out."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I don't have the money for a call girl."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"A streetwalker, then."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"That's cold, condemning your own brother to the pain of sexually transmitted disease."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Medical treatments are amazing nowadays, and syphilis couldn't possibly bore any more holes in your brain, so you're probably safe."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Well, I guess I'll work on my notes and call you back tonight."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Don't ever call me back!" The phone hung up, leaving me alone with my bread.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Despite what she said, my sister looked forward to my calls. I knew she sat there next to the phone every morning and evening, eagerly awaiting my newest theories on literature. She was just too much of a tsundere to admit it, so she pretended to dislike it and made fun of me all the time.</span></p><p class="standard"><span class="T2">I finished my bread, thinking of what I could add to my theory that </span><span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1">Twelfth Night </span><span class="T2">was essentially a story of woniichan moe, and prepared my things to go to college. A heavily annotated literature anthology, an MP3 player (not an iPod, the cheap kind), a sandwich, and a digital camera went in to my backpack. An economics textbook, math textbook, and cell phone (not a smartphone, the cheap kind) stayed behind. My mom—or possibly my other sister, Sue, acting as a proxy for my mom—kept putting the phone in my backpack, and I kept taking it out. They were all gone already: my mother and father to work, Sue to high school, and Mia to elementary school. Lucy's school was only a fifteen minute drive from our uncle's house, where she lived, so she could leave later. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>I went out into the quiet suburb where I lived and began the walk to the bus stop. It was a forty-five minute bus ride to the next town, where I had been attending college for the past two semesters. I was still waiting on all that learning that was supposed to happen, though. In the meantime, I kept myself busy by creeping out Lucy and by running a small news blog that I maintained in my spare time. As the editor in chief and only reporter, I couldn't update it very often, but I tried to cover anything important that happened in this town. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>Incidentally, I used middle-aged women from around town as my primary sources. They were always good for wild rumor and speculation, and if I investigated and it turned out to be untrue or exaggerated, I still had a story debunking the rumors. I bring this up because one of them was approaching me, a Mrs. Rankin, neighborhood gossip and one of my top sources.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"James! Good morning to you," said Mrs. Rankin as she approached me, coming the opposite way up the street, I assumed from the beauty salon. She was always up at the crack of dawn getting beauty treatments.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Good morning, Mrs. Rankin," I replied. "Anything going on?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Actually, yes. I'm glad I ran into you. Now, this is just a rumor, but some of the women in the PTA are saying that one of its members, a Mrs. Sullivan, withdrew her son from school under strange circumstances."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"What kind of strange circumstances?" I asked.</span></p><p class="standard"><span class="T2">"They say he had a very strange medical condition," said Mrs. Rankin. "And this, after three other women also withdrew their children from school with strange medical conditions. Now, mind you, this is just a rumor, but they say Mrs. Sullivan's child was </span><span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1">pregnant</span><span class="T2">."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Pregnant," I repeated. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Yes, a ten-year-old boy, pregnant."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>This was certainly a rumor in need of some debunking, due to being a biological impossibility. I thanked Mrs. Rankin for her information and said I would surely investigate before continuing to school.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Schools contain all sorts of professors. Old professors, young professors, male professors, female professors. Traditional professors, radical professors. Invariably, some of the professors are more popular among students than others.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>And in a college like this, where most of the students had 2.75 GPAs and rather conservative upbringings, it's not all that surprising that a teacher who says things like</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I'd like to start today's class with a discussion of 'The Flea'. I hope you all read it, and were able to see that the flea represents taxes, the annoyance of which affects all of us equally."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>would become rather popular. Never mind that eighty percent of the class had never paid any taxes and the remaining twenty percent had just had them automatically deducted from a paycheck and then had gotten them back later. Taxes were evil, said Professor Latrom, and every time he said it, the room filled with a general feeling that he was a paragon of justice whose mouth spoke only truth, and a small group of students was practically frothing at the mouth, so eager were they to agree with him. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>As I said, I didn't think that taxes were an issue which anyone in the class particularly cared about. They were just at that age where they were starting to become aware of the wider world and would latch on to just about anything in order to have a cause. It wasn't the issue; it was the way Latrom made you feel about it. He could just as well have been talking about the environment, or whether it was better to eat toast with the butter side up or the butter side down. But when he made statements like</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"They're stealing from you, the youth, the next generation, and I think it's wrong. It's wrong for the old and infirm to take from the young and strong to keep themselves fat and happy for a few more years. They're plundering our future, the future of this nation!",</span></p><p class="standard"><span class="T2">which he had said last week when we looked at Christopher Marlowe's "The Passionate </span><span class="T2">Shepherd to his Love", it tended to shut down the mammalian brain and turn on the reptilian brain. By </span><span class="T2">the way, if you were to ask me how he segued from shepherd love to taxes, I couldn't tell you, because I had been partially asleep until I was rudely awakened by the statement above and forced to endure </span><span class="T2">another rant about our future.</span></p><p class="standard"><span class="T2">Latrom was in fine form again today. He started off by examining the line "And pampered swells with one blood made of two", connecting it to government bureaucrats who grew fat on their tax-supplied salaries and quoting a rather long passage from </span><span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1">Atlas Shrugged </span><span class="T2">straight from memory. I glanced around and saw most of the class sitting up with rapt attention, and before long someone raised his hand and launched into a mini-rant of his own before Latrom cut him off in the middle to continue his own rant, moving on to the line "And this, alas, is more than we would do." and explaining how it referred to the narrator as a private sector worker who tried to get ahead through hard work and intelligence instead of mooching from taxpayers.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I think I've made it clear how popular Latrom was, how a Stalin-like cult of personality had grown around him among the members of the class. So it should come as no surprise that when someone stood up without being called on and said "There's no basis in the text for any of that." and then proceeded to quote a line his little sister had halfway uttered that morning about not going too far afield with our interpretations, that someone was hardly cheered and feted. In fact, when Latrom responded by launching into another rant and that someone simply wrote off the contents of that rant as something else that had no basis in the text, I think it's safe to say that someone was lucky to escape from the class alive. Especially after Latrom launched into yet another rant and that someone waved his hand and said "Whatever" in a dismissive tone. I think it's safe to say that someone barely avoided being bitten by groupies foaming at the mouth as he left.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I think it's safe to say that someone wasn't very good at reading the mood. But maybe he'd just had it.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>In order to prevent a riot, that someone left the classroom amid the screams and ravings of Professor Latrom and several other members of the class and went to the library to lay low for a while. And if that someone became angry and spent several hours looking up various interpretations of "The Flea", none of them having anything to do with taxes, and sent citations of all those papers to Professor Latrom along with some rather inflammatory comments about that luminary's teaching skill, who among us can blame him? I certainly can't.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It was while gathering references that she approached. I had seen her in class a few times. Glasses. Mousy brown hair, usually in a braid or held back with a headband, and always sticking up everywhere like she hadn't brushed it. Sort of a delicate jawline, like one of those porcelain-faced dolls.  She usually wore jeans with a blouse tucked in or a long skirt, modest clothing. All in all, she looked like an attractive girl who was trying to look unattractive, and had gone about it by copying the pre-transformation look of the girl from a high school movie who's ugly until some stud muffin takes it on himself to date her, at which time she brushes her hair and puts on some nice clothes, magically transforming into a babe. </span><span></span></p><p class="standard"><span>We had never spoken before, so I wasn't expecting her to approach me, and when she did I didn't respond at first because I thought she was just passing by. But when she didn't pass by, and instead started to look embarrassed, I decided that maybe she was trying to talk to me for some reason. I waited for her to say something, but she just stood there looking embarrassed, so I decided that she was probably autistic and said "Can I help you?" in a tone which I had not intended to be so condescending.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Um, I just wanted to let you know that I agree with your interpretation of 'The Flea'," she said. "I mean, I agree with you, there's no basis in the text to say it has anything to do with taxes."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>This was a surprise. I eyed her with suspicion, wondering what her angle was. "Well, thank you for saying so," I said.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I thought it was brave of you to stand up to Latrom like that," she added. "Most of us are tired of his haranguing, but there are those few students who hang on to his every word...and he can be pretty intimidating."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I didn't find Latrom particularly intimidating, but felt it would be rude to say so. I also felt it would be rude to point out that it wasn't just a few students who sat hanging on Latrom's every word, so I didn't. I just nodded, hoping I looked thoughtful and gracious, feeling mistrustful, hoping I didn't look mistrustful, feeling that I probably did.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Oh, by the way, my name is Sophia. Sophia de Nuit." She extended her hand.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Da knee?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"De Nuit," she repeated, and I could hear the hint of a French accent. I took her extended hand and tried to smile.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I'm James Moran." I almost added that I liked piña coladas and long walks on the beach, just in case she was planning to ask me on a date to better manipulate me. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Nice to meet you, James." She smiled, a dazzling expression, even with her wild hair. "Well, I just wanted to tell you that. I'll see you later. then?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Yeah." I nodded and watched her go. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>What was her angle?</span></p><p class="standard"><span>What could she possibly stand to gain by buttering me up?</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It wasn't like I had money or power.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It wasn't like I had the prospect of ever having money or power.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I decided she could only mean to humiliate me somehow. It was a pain, but I would have to deal with it at some point. Not now, though. I had investigating to do.</span></p>

      <div id="chaptertext">
        <p class="standard"><span>Mrs. Sullivan's house was a normal house. It was almost painfully normal. A well-manicured lawn, a concrete driveway, a garage with two cars parked inside, lawn gnomes, roses planted along the front wall. If the spirit of normalcy had a home, this was it.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I rang the doorbell, expecting an older woman to come to the door, hear why I had come, and shut the door in my face. Instead, a woman who was probably in her mid-thirties, with blonde hair cut in a bob, answered the door and said "Yes? Something I can help you with?" as if she genuinely wanted to help me.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I introduced myself and explained that I was here to ask some questions for a news story. I avoided saying anything about her son being pregnant. After all, even I have that much sense. I simply said I had heard about several children being withdrawn from school with strange medical conditions and was doing an investigation. To my surprise, Mrs. Sullivan did not shut the door in my face or tell me to get the hell off her property. Instead, she invited me inside, sat me down at the kitchen table with a glass of iced tea, and told me to call her "June" instead of "Mrs. Sullivan".</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Hearing 'Mrs. Sullivan' makes me feel so old," she explained. "My mother in law is 'Mrs. Sullivan'."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I see."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"So, James, what sort of questions would you like to ask me?" She smiled warmly. "By the way, if the tea isn't sweet enough for you, I can add more sugar."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"No, it's fine. Anyway, I hear that you withdrew your son from school because of some sort of medical condition."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"That's correct."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"What sort of condition was it?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"That's a...sensitive issue, James. It's something I'd rather not talk about. Something that could be embarrassing for my son." She sat down across from me and touched my left arm. "You understand, don't you? How cruel children can be."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Of course. If you'd rather not talk to me—"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Oh, of course I'll talk to you. It's only, I'd like you to keep us anonymous. You know, like in magazines, when the name has the little star next to it."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"As I said, I'm investigating this as part of a series of incidents, so it may not even be necessary to mention a name." </span></p><p class="standard"><span>"But if you do give one, you'll give a starred name?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Of course."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Mrs. Sullivan gave a theatrical sigh of relief. "My son started to behave strangely. He had always been a happy child, but he began to show signs of depression. And he started to hurt himself. My husband and I thought he might be having problems at school, and we looked into changing schools, but my cousin is a therapist, and she advised us to find mental health help for him. We found a local therapist, who referred us to a psychiatrist, and the psychiatrist advised removing him from school for a short time to deal with the symptoms."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Do you know if any of the other children who were withdrawn had symptoms like that?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I know of three. The first was Amber Linney. I...don't like to speak badly of others, but Jane Linney isn't a very good mother, and Amber has pretty much raised herself, so none of us were very surprised when she left school. But then the Thompsons and the Patels took their children out of school; the Thompsons claimed their son had appendicitis, and the Patels claimed tonsillitis, but they've been out of school for over a month, and it doesn't take that long to recover from minor diseases like those, does it?'</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I had no idea how long it took to recover from tonsillitis or appendicitis, so Mrs. Sullivan's speculation wasn't of much use to me. I noticed that her hand had moved from my arm to my hand. She was petting the back of my hand like a hamster. It wasn't that I found her touch particularly distasteful, but this conversation was going in a weird direction, and I decided the best thing would be to bail, quickly. I asked my last question, with every intention of escaping after that.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Was there any change at school just before your son's symptoms developed?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I can't think of anything, no." </span></p><p class="standard"><span>"And was there any connection at all between your son, the Thompsons' and Patels' children, and Amber Linney?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Mrs. Sullivan thought for a moment, her hand still rubbing mine. I drained the glass of tea and noticed that I had been tapping my fingers on the table without realizing it. "The only connection I can think of is the after-school program."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Tell me about it." Quickly. And stop rubbing my hand. Of course, saying such a thing would put a damper on her cooperation, so I didn't. But still, this visit was going in a weird direction, and I wanted to end it before it reached a weird destination.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"It was run by Pastor Austen, from the World of Light Church. It was sort of like Sunday school five days a week, but Pastor Austen would also sometimes have the children do volunteer work in the community. Amber was sort of like his assistant."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>After finding out where Amber Linney lived, I nodded and stood up, perhaps a bit too abruptly.  "Thank you very much for your help, Mrs. Sul—June."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Is that all? Well, please come back if you have any more questions."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I will. Thank you for the tea, it was delicious."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>With that, I fled from that painfully normal house with as much speed as I dared. If Sophia Frenchy-Face's motives were entirely mysterious, it seemed plain enough what Mrs. Sullivan's angle was: she wanted to ensure anonymity for herself and her son. She had decided that it would be easier to obtain by getting on my good side than by slamming the door in my face, and had apparently decided, like Frenchy, that I looked like a pathetic sort who would be easiest to sway with feminine wiles and innuendo. I couldn't really fault her conclusion, since I also thought that I looked like a pathetic sort who could easily be swayed by feminine wiles. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>Satisfied with my conclusion, I put Mrs. Sullivan out of my mind and focused on Amber Linney. If I heard anything from her about this Pastor Austen, I'd probably pay him a visit too, but in the meantime, I had chosen Amber Linney of the three that Mrs. Sullivan had mentioned because of her lack of parental supervision. My talk with Mrs. Sullivan hadn't been completely fruitless, but I had known better than to ask her permission to speak with her son; it would not be given. I had thought I would probably have to ambush the kid somewhere and try to talk to him, but Amber Linney was the perfect alternative; even if she happened to be with her mother right now, I could probably count on finding a time when she would be alone and unsupervised, when I might be able to get a firsthand account out of her.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>So for that reason, I headed for Harrington Hills Trailer Park, which was outside of Santa Robles. I was actually going back the way I had come, towards the college, but I had an unlimited bus pass and nothing better to do. My nightly call to Lucy was usually made around eight, and since I hadn't worked on my notes at all, I was thinking about ditching her tonight, though I felt guilty about the disappointment I would cause her, my dearest sister who had stuck near to the phone instead of going out with her friends just to speak with me. But, being the sort of terrible person who is constantly disappointing everyone, this feeling was far from alien to me. In fact, my sister was so dear to me because she had endured so many disappointments, and yet had never even considered abandoning me; I could not even hope to put into words my gratitude to her, so instead I decided to show it by actions and headed for the nearest bus stop to got on a bus heading for the outskirts of Santa Robles.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It was a forty-five minute bus ride to the middle of Santa Robles, where the college was, and I had to walk for another half-hour or so, since I wasn't familiar with this area and didn't want to get on a bus going in the wrong direction. Eventually, I reached Harrington Hills Trailer Park.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I had never been here before, so I had no image of a trailer park except what I had seen in movies and on television.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Those depictions on movies and television are wrong.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I'd like to say they were unjust libel against a lot of hardworking, honest people, but the evidence of my eyes, ears, and nose suggested the movies and television shows had gone easy on the people who lived here, or else the writers of those movies and television shows had only visited the richer sort of trailer park.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>As soon as I walked in, the faint scent of raw sewage and industrial chemicals wafted at me on an ill-met wind. Even though it was summer and no rain had fallen in months, the trailer park sat in a pit of thick, viscous mud that stuck to everything like glue. Every trailer and car I saw had a skirt of black mud around the bottom. Fortunately, I had worn my cheap tennis shoes and wasn't very concerned if they were ruined. My mother had a nose like a bloodhound, and if even a hint of raw sewage and industrial chemicals remained on my shoes or clothes after coming here, she would make me throw out the offending items.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>People were sitting and laying in the mud, leaned against piles of wreckage that looked to be composed of thirty percent scrap metal, twenty percent rotting plywood, and fifty percent cigarette butts, empty beer bottles, and chip bags, with trace amounts of other kinds of junk. I understood why the children would sit in the mud like that—actually, from the look in their eyes, I understood why the adults were doing it as well. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>Any adult who was halfway conscious was glaring at me with suspicion. Probably they thought I was some sort of police officer. I suppose in their position I'd also think I was some sort of police officer, and also I would want to resist the urge to look at my most valued possession that most people experience when they think that possession might be threatened, because the possession was probably a meth lab.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>All in all, it was a place smothered by dirt and desperation. I could see why an objective observer like Mrs. Sullivan would call Jane Linney a bad mother for raising her daughter in such a place, though I also thought that perhaps Jane Linney had her reasons and it was wrong to judge her. </span><span>Either way, I was the scumbag taking advantage of the fact that Jane Linney had chosen to raise her daughter in a place like this, so I guess that makes me worse than the most degenerate drug addict in this place.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I searched for someone I could ask about Amber Linney's whereabouts. At first I considered one of the children, but none of them looked like they would talk to me—in fact, the two I tried asking stared at me like I was a pedophile and ran away. Well, that was probably the correct response to strange adults for a child living in a place like this. So instead, I found the weakest looking adult I could—one that I could probably outrun, or even outfight. He was lying in the mud with his head resting on a pile of empty burlap sacks, but his eyes were open, and he was clutching a bottle of something wrapped in a brown paper bag. That was somewhat encouraging—maybe he wasn't a drug addict, but merely an alcoholic.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Excuse me," I said. "Could you tell me where Amber Linney is?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"What are you, a kiddie cop?" my chosen guide asked in response. "Gonna take her from her mother again?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I'm—from the school." I deliberately chose a role which I felt was likely to be nonthreatening. No cop, just a teacher. Just a weak teacher, no gun, no baton, no handcuffs, no reading Miranda rights. "I just want to talk to her."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Huh. Well, if you was gonna take her, I could tell you some things, maybe help you out a little, if you'd help me. Like the time I shared a bottle of Wild Turkey with her. Maybe I could tell you about that, in exchange for another bottle of Turkey. How's that?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>That would actually get him in trouble, not Jane Linney, but I didn't bother telling him that. Instead, I took ten dollars from my pocket. "Okay, I've got one Hamilton here. Mr. Hamilton says he's willing to buy you a bottle of something if you'll tell me where Amber Linney is."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>My guide leered at me and sat up, with some effort. "Go that way." He pointed behind me, to my left. "If you go far enough, you'll come to a place where there ain't no trailers, just some storage sheds and a bunch of wrecked cars. Last I knew, she was in one of them wrecked cars."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I was about to hand him the ten, but upon finishing his speech, he immediately passed out, and I wasn't exactly swimming in a tub of money myself these days, so I decided to do what Scrooge McDuck would have and retain the services of Mr. Hamilton. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>I followed my guide's instructions and walked down the row of trailers. Looking at them as I passed, I could see that while many of the trailers were wrecks eaten through by rust, some of them were merely dirty and only needed a good scrubbing to look somewhat respectable. The trailers which were merely dirty seemed to all have old but serviceable pickup trucks parked next to them, while the true wrecks either had no car or a heap of rust so distraught it made the trailer itself look like Mrs. Sullivan's sickeningly normal suburban house. Some of them emitted a much stronger stench of industrial chemicals, and I assumed these were the ones where methamphetamine was cooked.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Then, abruptly, the line of trailers stopped, capped by a dilapidated wooden shed. The door hung open, and inside I could see a hammer, sickle, crowbar, axe, and screwdriver, all impossibly rusted, hanging on the wall above an ancient lawnmower. This shed presumably belonged to the superintendent of the park. As there was no grass, I imagined the lawnmower and sickle didn't see much use, but the state of disrepair led me to believe the other tools weren't used much for fixing things either. They had probably been used against those late on their rent more recently than they had been used to fix anything.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Beyond this shed was, as my guide had suggested, an empty field full of broken cars. Like everything else in Harrington Hills, they were mostly rust, though broken glass clung to the window frames of some of them. Also, some community-minded person had taken it upon himself to decorate most of them using a can of spray paint. His artistic style showed a clear influence from hip-hop and guerrilla art, and his use of color was most impressive.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I began to search the wrecked cars, wondering how they got away with calling this place Harrington Hills when I hadn't seen anything like a hill the whole time. As I weaved through the piles of metal and broken glass, I noticed there was actually some grass here. I could certainly see how this would be a good place for a young girl to escape to; for one thing, there didn't seem to be anyone asleep on the ground here. Maybe they had a religious fear of this place. Perhaps it was like Mr. MacGregor's garden for them. And some of these cars had been nice at one point, so there was probably one with pretty decent upholstery around here somewhere, a comfortable seat to rest in. Making use of that reasoning, I started looking for cars with nice upholstery, but my knowledge of car models is somewhere between nonexistent and fraudulent, falling in the existence spectrum between Nessie and the Cottingley fairies, so I soon gave up and just looked for a girl in the car.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It took me about twenty minutes of searching before I saw a blonde head in a red Chrysler LeBaron festooned with Bush/Quayle bumper stickers, at which time I realized that I could have just called out her name. Then again, I remembered how the children I had tried to speak to had reacted to me. But Amber sure had chosen a well-hidden car; it was deep within the auto graveyard, and the windows were so grimy that if her hair weren't so bright blonde, and if she hadn't happened to move just as I was looking, I never would have seen her. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>I came up along the driver's side window and knocked on the door. "Amber Linney?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She jumped, clearly surprised to see me, and rolled down the window with some effort. She was a pretty child, with blue eyes alongside the bright blonde hair that had given away her position, and a noble cast to her face, as if meant to live a life in which she had everything and nothing was satisfactory. She didn't deserve to grow up in this place. Not that ugly children deserved to grow up in this place either.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She was older than I'd expected. I'd thought she would be at most eleven or twelve, but she looked just a little younger than my sister Sue, fourteen or fifteen. And she was glaring at me with the same suspicion as the people from the entrance, but also with a dirty look that suggested speaking to me was beneath her.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Who're you?" she asked.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"My name is James. I'm sort of a reporter. I work on local news stories and post them on the Internet. Are you Amber?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"That's right."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I had a hard time finding you."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"That's because I was hiding." Her glare intensified.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Oh."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I heard you coming, so I headed deeper in. Figured this car was the best hiding spot, but it's too hard to hear through it."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I see."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"So whaddya want?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I heard you've been out of school a lot recently."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Yeah, so? That ain't news."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Not just you. Three other kids, younger than you. I heard that the four of you were involved in Pastor Austen's after-school program."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Austen? Yeah, he was greasing his pole on me. Thought it was just me. I didn't know he went after the younger kids. Who'd he get?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Will you answer my questions if I tell you?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I didn't really think this would work; her question seemed like it came from idle curiosity more than concern. When her glare somehow got even more intense, I thought she was about to yell at me and run off, or possibly slam the car door in my face. However, I was in for a surprise.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I think kiddie bangers should have their balls twisted off, <span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1">James</span><span class="T2">." For some reason she spat my name with contempt, as if she suspected me of banging kiddies on the side. "I'm one thing, but going after the kids is just wrong. So tell me, don't tell me, either way I'll answer your goddamn questions."</span></span></p><p class="standard"><span>I told her. When she heard the name of Sullivan, her lip curled as if in ironic mirth. "So Austen was a fag too? He was after the boys too? Well, can't say I didn't see that coming."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"What do you mean?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Amber patted the passenger seat of the LeBaron. "Sit down, James. This is gonna take a minute."</span></p><p class="standard"></p><p class="standard"><span>I didn't trust her. She wasn't exactly small for her age, so I probably couldn't have thrown her very far, but I didn't trust her even as far as I could throw her.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>But her story was too intriguing to pass up. Even if it was all a lie, even if she had made it up out of pure malice, it wasn't something I could just ignore.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>And if it was true, it was the sort of thing that a comfortable suburban housewife like Mrs. Sullivan never would have told me. Even if she knew it.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Amber Linney had never known her father, or so she told me. He'd run off before she was born, and possibly didn't even know he had a daughter. Her mother, Jane Linney, had raised her in that trailer park alone. When Amber was young, Jane had done her best. She'd worked two jobs, Walmart during the day and a bar in Santa Robles at night, to afford rent, food, and clothing for the two of them. And she had made a point of bring Amber to church every Sunday, to the World of Light Church.</span></p><p class="standard"><span class="T2">Whenever Jane couldn't look out for her, the pastor, Joseph Austen, would take care of Amber. He saw her through Jane's breakdown, when the stress got to be too much and Jane started drinking heavily. He saw her through Jane's second breakdown, when the drinking got to be too much and Jane started using crack cocaine and methamphetamine heavily. He somehow found a way to provide food </span><span class="T2">and clothes for her when Jane quit both of her jobs and started turning tricks in exchange for alcohol, crack cocaine, and methamphetamine. He had even given her the job as assistant supervisor of the </span><span class="T2">after-school program, and paid her a little so she could have some freedom.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The touching had started last year, when Amber was thirteen. One day, in his office, Austen had given Amber a cell phone for her birthday. She was grateful. She'd been wanting one for a while, but no store would sell her one without any credit history. When she told Austen how grateful she was, he told her there was a way she could repay the favor. A few minutes later, she was naked and on her knees. A graphic description of what exactly she did in this state had followed, but I'll omit it here.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>A short while after the touching started, Amber had been sent to the hospital with an envelope of money and instructed to give it to Mr. and Mrs. Robson. They were members of the congregation, and their son was in the hospital. Amber assumed the money was a gift from the church to help them pay for their son's surgery. She had gone up to Richard Robson's room and found a doctor, but no Mr. or Mrs. Robson. Out of curiosity, she'd asked the doctor what kind of surgery Richie was getting. And the doctor had replied that it was a Cesarean section, with a weird expression on his face.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Amber had waited, and soon Mr. Robson returned. She gave him the envelope, but he didn't seem happy or grateful. Instead, he looked angry. He wouldn't take the money, and told her to bring it back to Pastor Austen and tell him they knew he'd done this somehow and they were going to press charges. Amber had done just that, confused, and Pastor Austen had just laughed and said they should have taken the money.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Richie Robson never came back to school or church.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>His parents also disappeared. They never pressed charges.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>A short while later, Amber had asked the school nurse what a Cesarean section was for. The nurse told her it was for getting out babies when something went wrong and they couldn't be born properly. Amber had always thought only girls could have babies. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>She'd been right, of course. It was a biological impossibility.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>A little after that, Amber herself became pregnant.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I looked in books," she said. "I read the little booklets they gave us at school. It said your period ends when you're pregnant. That's how I knew I was. But I never got big or anything. And it's supposed to take nine months, but it only took me about three."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"What happened to the baby?" I asked.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Amber smirked. "I don't even know if you could call that thing a baby," she said. "It looked like some kinda monster. It was all grey and shriveled and hairless. It had a tail."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"What happened to it?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I left it in one of the cars. Way over there." She waved her arm vaguely into the distance. "I guess it probably died. It never cried or anything. Just sorta grinned at me, like some kinda weird monkey."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Male or female?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Oh, male, for sure. I could see its thing. It was bigger than Austen's, you know."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Why did you stop going to school recently?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"He told me to. Austen. He didn't say why."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I thought for a minute. No one in my family was religious, so I had never heard of Joseph Austen before Mrs. Sullivan mentioned him earlier, but it seemed like he was a pretty big deal in the community, so this story would be significant if it turned out to be true. The easiest way I could think of to verify it would be talking to Austen himself. Whether it was true or not, he would deny it, but the way he denied it could help me decide what spin to put on the story when I published it: innocent pastor unjustly maligned by conniving girl, or evil child molester accused by his first victim. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>The police could take it from there.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>But I'd prefer to catch him off guard when I brought it up, so his reaction would be as natural as possible. Mrs. Sullivan didn't seem to suspect anything, so the only one who might warn him was Amber Linney. How to find out.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I decided the direct way was best.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Amber, do you talk to Austen regularly?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"No, we haven't talked at all since he told me to quit school."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Are you planning to tell him you talked to me?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Why would I do a stupid thing like that? He sexed up all those little kids, and I wanna hammer him for it. I'd go to the cops myself, except they wouldn't believe me."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I pointed out that the cops were ready to jump on even the slightest accusation of pedophilia nowadays in hopes of being heroes in the news, but</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I lied to the cops that my mom was beating me up so they'd take me away from her, and they found out, so they don't believe anything I say anymore,"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>said Amber.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I thanked her for her time and was about to leave, but she stopped me and said that she couldn't use the Internet and asked if I would send her a copy of the story when it was done. I said I would and also asked if I could find her here if I wanted to ask any more questions, and she said she would be, but she wasn't going to answer any more questions unless I brought her some Plan B and a carton of Virginia Slims.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"If you bring me those pills, I might even use one for you," she added. I laughed nervously at that remark, trying to laugh like I wasn't nervous, and ran away, trying to look like I wasn't running away.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Damn, even fourteen-year-old girls mess with me like that.</span></p>

    </div><div class="chapter">
      <h2 id="heading"><a id="Chapter_3">03</a></h2>
      <div id="chaptertext">
        <p class="standard"><span>It was already dark by the time I reached the college. From here I could ride the bus back home, and planned to, as soon as I could find one. I walked into the nightlife area, a circle of bars, nightclubs, dives, diners, and fast food restaurants that surrounded the college like a ring of fire. Since I didn't live in Santa Robles, I had no idea what the locals called this area; I had just decided it was "the nightlife area" because in practice, that seemed to be what it was. I could have just as easily come up with some quasi-clever name like "Drunkard's Alley" or "Circus Brain-Minimus" that would sound better in a book, and make me look quasi-clever for coming up with it, but in the end, quasi-cleverness isn't something I aspire to, and "the nightlife area [around the college]" was a name I wouldn't have to explain to other people who didn't live near the college if I happened to mention it. As a test of this principal, I had tried complaining to both Lucy and Sue that everyone in my class was more interested in spending time in the nightlife area around the college than learning anything, and both of them had passed over the name without question before telling me to stop acting like a bigshot honor student when I had left high school with a 1.9 GPA. On the other hand, when I tried telling my other sister Mia that everyone in my class was more interested in spending time in Circus Brain-Minimus than learning anything, she looked at me weird and went away without saying anything.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Of course, a seven-year-old might also have trouble with "the nightlife area around the college." </span><span>At the very least, she couldn't be expected to know what "nightlife" meant.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Buses stopped coming to the college at seven, so I had just missed the last one. I didn't like to be here this late. It wasn't that I was scared or anything—the nightlife area was one of the Three Sacred Treasures of Santa Robles, along with the college and the fish hatchery, and so was heavily guarded by the police—but last time I'd had to catch a bus from here, some drunk jerk with a Farsi accent had been sitting next to me in the bus stop and forced me to listen to a twenty minute rant, in slurred, barely understandable English, about the need for women's rights. I would probably agree that most places where people speak Farsi need more women's rights, but telling me about it wasn't going to solve anything, and neither was getting drunk and then getting kicked out of the bar by the bouncer for pretending to trip on a spilled cocktail and sticking your nose up a woman's skirt as you got up, which he had admitted to doing, then fiercely denied ever thinking of doing. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>But it was worth it for Amber's story. No matter what the spin was—"Poor victim speaks at last" or "Evil girl pretends she was raped"—it was a big story. Worth another twenty minute rant. Maybe worth a thirty minute rant. Forty was pushing it.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>If I could get a story from Austen, it might be worth forty minutes.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Some nights, bands were playing on the streets and it was so loud you could barely hear your inability to hear, but tonight was quiet. All the music was inside, where it belonged. I walked along beneath the streetlights, looking for a bus stop and trying to avoid the gum stuck all over the sidewalk, mostly out of habit, since my shoes were still encrusted with disgusting black mud that smelled faintly of raw sewage and industrial chemicals and were probably going in the trash whether they got gum on them or not. I was on one of the side streets and wasn't seeing a trace of a bus stop, so at the next intersection, I crossed over to Royal Avenue, one of the larger thoroughfares.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Royal Avenue was mostly given over to cowboy bars, redneck bars, and biker bars. There <span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1">were</span>actual cowboys, rednecks, and bikers in the bars, but most of the patrons were just college students who treated the bars like a theme park where you could get drunk and pretend to not be a yuppie from a long line of yuppies, and instead pose as some kind of country tough guy. I couldn't think of many things funnier than a pudgy-faced eighteen-year-old Chinese boy with a fake ID in a flannel shirt and leather chaps with fringes sidled up to a bar and choking on his shots of rotgut bourbon while trying to stare you down like Clint Eastwood. I had only been here twice, once in daylight when everything was closed, and once while looking for a bus stop on a previous occasion. The real cowboys, rednecks, and bikers would glare at you like the people in the trailer park, seemingly wanting to say "You ain't from around here, is you?" like they were in some small town horror movie, while the posers in their brand new three hundred dollar cowboy boots would glance at you disdainfully for being here out of costume.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I wasn't disappointed; I was getting exactly the kinds of glares and disdainful glances that I had gotten last time I was here at night, though since it was a weeknight, the streets were more empty. I saw a bus stop on the other side of the street, but Royal Avenue was a wide street and it lacked good places to cross, so I turned around to look for an intersection at the same moment that a crowd of people issued from the entrance of one of the pseudo-dive bars.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>That was when I saw her.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>A girl who was unmistakably Sophia da Knee from earlier, coming out of the bar with a country-looking fellow with a dirty blonde handlebar mustache. She had brushed her hair and seemed to be wearing contacts, but I was only about thirty feet away when she came out and saw her in profile. Even her slinky red dress and black fishnet stockings weren't enough to disguise her.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>This was an opportunity.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>After all, I suspected that girl of trying to make a fool of me. And while I might make a fool of myself all the time, and I might let my sisters make a fool of me just so they could feel better about themselves, I wasn't about to let some random girl from the college manipulate and make a fool of me. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>And since I was something like a reporter, the best way for me to prevent that was to uncover something that would ruin her, then threaten to release it unless she left me alone. Reporters have done such things since early in the history of the press. It's our only weapon against tyranny and plutocracy. She was good-looking and she was French and she had read the assigned reading, so I figured that probably made her a tyrant or a plutocrat of some sort. Given that, it was my duty to find out what would ruin her and blackmail her with it.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>So I followed her.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She and the fellow soon split off from the group and crossed back to the side street I had come from, headed back towards the college. I followed at a distance, feeling my pocket to verify the continuing presence of my digital camera.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Just to be sure, I took out the camera.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>There was no way that man with her was her boyfriend. Or rather, if he was her boyfriend, their situation was highly irregular. He looked like he was in his forties or early fifties. His dirty, holey jeans and plaid shirt didn't speak to any particular wealth, but some women were happy just to squeeze a guy for a chunk of thirty thousand a year in wages, if their own prospects were dim enough. Still, she was in college, so I didn't see how she could be badly off enough to want to steal from a guy who didn't seem to have any money.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Well, maybe I was completely wrong.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Maybe he was a cattle baron.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Maybe he was an oil czar.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Maybe he was a prince.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Or  maybe I was wrong from the beginning to think that she wanted money. Maybe she was a nymphomaniac.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It occurred to me that some guys might be excited to think they were being targeted by a nymphomaniac. Guess I must be gay or something.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Whatever the situation was, I was going to find evidence. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>They were moving back towards the college. In fact, if they continued down this street, they would run straight into the small park next to the college, which I thought was technically part of the campus, but which was used like a normal park by the people of Santa Robles. I had come through it to get here, because after seven, a lot of the gates and doorways at the college were locked, and it was quicker to cut through the park than to try and walk through campus and end up having to take some long detour around a locked gate. Not to mention I had only been there for one semester (this was my second), so I didn't necessarily know of detours around all the gates that might be locked.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>My camera had a pretty decent zoom capability, so I turned it on and zoomed in, trying to see what I could of the faces of Sophia the Frenchy and her boyfriend/pimp/john/sugar daddy. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>The man was laughing.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The man was smiling.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The man was telling jokes. I couldn't hear their content, but I could hear the drone of his distant voice, the rhythms and beats of someone with an Oklahoma accent telling jokes.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The girl wasn't laughing.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The girl was vaguely smiling.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The girl wasn't speaking. I didn't see her mouth move at all, except to curl into an embarrassed sort of grin whenever the man finished a joke.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I didn't know where she got off being so sepulchral when no one twisted her arm to get her into a bar and make her seduce some guy in a plaid shirt and holey jeans who didn't look like he had any money. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>I started looking at the man's hand, searching for a wedding ring. It was hard to see, because he had his left arm firmly entwined in the girl's right arm, sort of like they were walking down the aisle together, but also like she was under arrest and he was restraining her. However, I got a good look when she started to move away from him a little and he reasserted his grip, taking her arm in his hand and pulling her back in.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>No ring. Not that that meant anything. It was easy to take off a ring.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>We reached the end of the sidewalk, where it curved off to follow the progress of Royal Avenue towards the highway, and crossed the street to the park. There was a crosswalk and a traffic light, but my targets ignored it and crossed on red. By some strange luck, the light had turned green by the time I reached the intersection, and I was able to make a legal crossing. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>Following the law is very important to me.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It's just the laws of morality and common decency that I flout.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>As I had predicted, they went into the park. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>They passed straight under a sign that said "Closes at sundown", ignoring it like it was a piece of overly frank advice from an acquaintance they'd rather not be acquainted with. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>Now that we were in the park, it was a bit weird for me to be following them, so I pulled back and put my camera on standby so the light from the screen wouldn't give me away. Fortunately, this side of the park featured a large grove of oak trees, so I could stay behind cover and hear their progress by the crunching of dead leaves, whereas they couldn't possibly hear me over the fellow's jokes.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I followed them through the grove to a clearing, where there were picnic tables and barbecue pits. I had thought that barbecue pits in parks had been banned at some point, but maybe I had heard wrong, or maybe the people who maintained this park just chose to ignore that law as thoroughly as the two I was following had ignored the traffic light. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>I was pretty sure they weren't here for a barbecue.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I settled down behind a tree and watched by the pale starlight, and by whatever light was reaching here from the streetlights around the park.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I wondered if I should leave. I may be someone with no common decency, but this was too far even for me. After all, it's not as if I was some kind of shady private investigator or paparazzo. This wasn't even a proper story. When you came down to it, it was just voyeurism.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>No, this was for the destruction of tyranny and plutocracy. It may be I would never need to use the pictures, but having them was just a sensible precaution. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>I thought about my night-vision camera, at home in my desk. I hadn't expected to need it, and that thing had cost me more money than anything I'd ever even considered buying, including every car I'd ever seriously looked at, so I didn't usually carry it around. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>The girl unzipped her dress.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She pushed it down off her chest. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>She pulled it up off her thighs.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It was too dark for me to see anything. I congratulated myself on not being a voyeur.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Finally, she spoke.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Please be gentle, it's my first time."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I doubted that, but the country fellow seemed to believe it. He pulled his holey jeans down and grabbed the girl by the shoulders.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It was too dark for me to see anything. I sighed with relief.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>For the last time, he spoke.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I been with lotsa virgins. I ain't gonna hurt ya."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>And it began.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I switched to video mode.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The clock in the corner of the video display ticked off the minutes. Twelve of them, to be exact. I held the camera on target while looking over the top of it. I watched the girl's face, wondering what was going through her mind. I was trying to see whether she looked greedy, or eager, or nymphomaniacal.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>At the end of twelve minutes, the country-looking fellow started moaning. I thought he was just getting his rocks off, but it didn't sound like that. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>It sounded like someone who's just looked down and discovered his legs aren't where they're supposed to be.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The girl cried out with pleasure. Just a single, short cry, quite modest, really, almost a gasp.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I thought I was hallucinating at first, but the man's skin seemed to be getting more and more wrinkled. Three seconds. After three seconds, he looked like a yellow prune. After three and a half seconds, the screaming stopped.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>After three and three quarters seconds, he fell off her, and he crumbled into dust.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I panicked.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I clenched my hand, and somehow hit the shutter.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The flash went off and the camera took a picture. The girl looked up, startled. I hit the shutter again and turned around, heaving myself to my feet and dashing off as fast as I could.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I ran until my legs were burning, across the street, ignoring the traffic light. I ran until my muscles were cramping, back to the light of human society, back to the glow of human technology, away from that horror in the clearing.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I passed the first bus stop I saw, my hamstrings tied in knots, my Achilles's tendons throbbing, my quadriceps seizing, and headed for the next one.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>By the time I reached it, I was so out of breath and my legs were in such pain that I couldn't run anymore. I sat down, huffing and puffing. I was under the streetlight. I was with my fellow humans. I was bathing in the light of Edison, safe from the dark places and the things that lived there.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I boarded a bus back to Donner's Rest. It was mostly empty, so I sat near the front by the driver. I wanted to be near people, near my fellow humans. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>I wanted to be near my sister.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>But no bus ran all the way to New York.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>After twenty minutes or so, I finally steeled myself to look at the two pictures I had taken at the end. The first one, the accident that had given me away, was too blurry to see anything. The second one showed the blurred outline of something red and pink mostly covered by darkness.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>But her face while it was going on was imprinted into my mind. She hadn't looked greedy, or eager, or nymphomaniacal. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>She had looked bored.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Bored, and a little sad.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>As if she'd seen all this before, and it depressed her having to see it all again.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I got home.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It was already past nine, and everyone else was asleep. I came in as quietly as I could. My mother had pinned a note to me to the refrigerator. James, it said. Your dinner is in the refrigerator. Please look at the attached sheet. I did as instructed and found a phone bill. My mother had written on it in angry capital letters, Stop calling Lucy from the house phone. Look at this long distance bill. Your cell phone has unlimited long distance, so use it.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Silly mother. That thing only has unlimited long distance after eight. Lucy's bedtime is eight, so I can't use that at all. I wrote this on the phone bill in laid back lowercase letters and stuck it to the refrigerator again. Then I took my dinner and went up to my room.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The cell phone I had left that morning had received a text message. It was from Lucy. I'll be glad to hear you out, so please work hard on your notes and tell me about it tomorrow, it said. I knew she loved me. Just one night of missing our call and she was already trying to apologize in her own way. I sent her a return text. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Sorry for missing you. Something came up and I was out late. Knew you loved me after all, heart mark."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I wrote, without expecting a reply, since it was past her bedtime. However, surprisingly, the phone vibrated and informed me that I had one new text message. "They used to burn brothers like you as heretics. I miss the good old days," it read.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I was about to leave the conversation there, since it was late and my thumbs hurt from entering the first message, but I decided to send just one more. "What does it mean if a young girl asks you to bring her Plan B pills and a carton of Virginia Slims and says if you do it, she might use one of the pills for you?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The phone vibrated again after a minute or two. "It means she wants to have sex with you, but doesn't want to get pregnant," said Lucy's reply. "Or else she really needs a nicotine fix. Go to sleep dreaming about it."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Silly sister. You know you're the only girl in my heart.</span></p>

      <div id="chaptertext">
        <p class="standard"><span>I didn't call Lucy the next morning.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Instead I sent her another text message apologizing and saying I wouldn't have my material ready for another few days, and left for school early.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>However, when I reached school, the absolute last thing I felt like doing was sitting through another one of Professor Pandit's economics lectures. Economics was possibly the most boring subject ever conceived of by the human mind. Last night, as I fled in panic from inhuman creatures lurking beyond the veil of reality, I may have been comforted to hear about marginal cost and margarine benefit and Margery's bloomers and Nashville's Equilibrium, which I assumed was the law governing the supply of aspiring country artists and corresponding demand for country music that predicted when acoustic guitar sales would once again skyrocket. It may have reminded me that such boring things existed in this world, things so boring you could just die of boredom, and perhaps the resultant catatonic state would have been enough to calm me down.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It wasn't that I couldn't understand it, I just wouldn't. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>I refused.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I was a conscientious objector.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>My brain closed the blinds and pretended not to be home the second it heard the word economics.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>When meeting with a counselor to decide your classes for the next semester, you should never flippantly say "I don't care, just give me the minimum number of units in whatever you think is important" and let her pick all your classes, not even looking at what she put down until the day you have to start attending. That's what gets you into classes like economics.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>At first I had thought it was one of those classes that was perennially empty, and she had put me in it just to fill it out and make sure it wasn't canceled. Then I discovered that everybody in the entire college was an economics major.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Also, I had discovered just after the add and drop period had ended that there was another section of the English literature class I was taking with Latrom, taught by someone who was not Latrom. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>Yet another reason why you should never let the counselor pick your classes.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Given the choice between something that was offensive in the eyes of my religion and a few hours in the library, I chose the latter.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I spent the first few hours <span class="T2">re-reading </span><span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1">A Critique of Pure Reason</span><span class="T2">and the next few hours reading </span><span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1">Pride and Prejudice</span><span class="T2">, which I had picked up purely because the cover bore a striking resemblance to the cover of </span><span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1">Twilight</span><span class="T2">. Out of curiosity, I had tracked down whatever other copies of </span><span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1">Pride and Prejudice </span><span class="T2">the library had. There was one with a gangster cover, one with a cover that looked like a Black Sabbath album, one with a cover that looked like the logo of </span><span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1">Laugh-In!</span><span class="T2">, one with a cover that looked like a </span><span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1">Goosebumps </span><span class="T2">book, and one whose cover was the original theatrical poster from </span><span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1">Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope</span><span class="T2">, but with the title replaced by </span><span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1">Pride and Prejudice</span><span class="T2">.</span></span></p><p class="standard"><span>I wondered if Amber Linney would pick the book up if she saw the gangster cover. It looked like the spray paint on her wrecked cars.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I was sitting in a pile of Prides and Prejudices when she approached.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>From behind.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>And laid a hand on my shoulder.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I nearly had a heart attack.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I jumped out of my seat.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>And then I managed to play it cool.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Just play it cool.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Like three little Fonzies.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Be wary, but don't let her know that you're being wary.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Well, it was probably too late for that.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you like that," she said.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Ah, well, don't worry about it. I startle easily," I explained.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I noticed you weren't in class today."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Of course I wasn't. It's Thursday, Latrom's class is Monday, Wednesday, and Friday."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"No, I mean, we're also in economics and math together...Didn't you notice?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"No, not in the slightest."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She laughed. "I guess I'm not very memorable."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It was hard to notice anyone in classes of three hundred students like those; Latrom's only had about thirty, even on exam days. Furthermore, she was going out of her way to look unmemorable. But it was hard to forget about her after last night. It was hard to forget someone who, after twelve minutes and three seconds of sex with a random stranger, had somehow reduced him to a dried-out husk that crumbled into dust, like a corn husk left sitting in the sun for eight years.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Anyway, I thought you might be sick, but I decided to check here anyway, and here you are!"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Yup, here I am."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Do you want to borrow my notes or anything?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"No, if I tried to read someone's notes about economics, my brain would run away to join the circus. I'll just fail, if it's all right with you."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She laughed again. It was a nice sound. A happy, girlish sound. Like a pony's neigh.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Well, here, at least take my notes for math. We covered permutations and combinations today." She reached into her shoulder bag and took out a notebook labeled "Math 10" in fancy Gothic letters. She sure did have some penmanship. I admired the lettering for a moment before I shook my head.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Oh, you don't want them?" The notebook went back into the bag, and she ran her fingers through her unbrushed hair. "Don't worry, it's not like my notebook will suck the life out of you or anything."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I had no such concern."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Well, look, James..." She ran her fingers through her hair again, nervously. "I'm sorry, this is really embarrassing...Um, I know you saw me last night."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Huh."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I guess this wasn't unexpected. After all, I had screwed up and drawn her attention to me, and I assumed that, as a creature of the night, she could see in the dark pretty well, so it wasn't surprising that she'd recognized me.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Being seen by someone, especially you, it's so embarrassing, I could die. So please, give me a chance to explain myself, won't you?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>There was only one way to escape from this situation with my life.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Nothing can explain what I saw last night. Therefore, I have decided it was a hallucination."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>By the way, that wasn't the one way to escape with my life. The one way I could have possibly escaped would have been to deny vociferously having seen anything last night, then move to New York  and support Lucy with a job unloading goods at the docks, working under the name of Carlos Ramirez. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>The girl in front of me took three deep breaths and smiled. "That's right. It was all a hallucination." She ran her fingers through her hair again. "Well, I'll see you around."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>At this point I might have had a chance. That might have been enough for her. Or she might have waited in the parking lot with a sniper rifle to gun me down. Either way, saying,</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"That wasn't a hallucination."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>was not the right thing to do. Adding,</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Tell me what the hell happened."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>was even more wrong. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>And stopping her by grabbing the trailing end of her hair and pulling on it, like some first-grader, was the most wrong thing of all the many wrong things I did in that moment.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>But somehow, she didn't slit my throat and leave me to drown in my own blood. Instead she glanced backward in mild shock that anyone would grab another person's mousy brown, unbrushed hair to stop her from going and said, "Want to eat lunch with me? Otherwise I won't tell you. Oh, I'll pay, so don't worry about money."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>We went to the cafeteria.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I had never actually eaten here. I usually either brought lunch or starved until I got home. It was so noisy that there was no way anyone could have a decent conversation, and once a food fight broke out, she declared with mild chagrin that there was no way we could talk here, and we brought our food outside to a bench.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>By the way, she actually did buy my lunch. It wasn't cheap, either. For nine dollars each, we got three strips of fried breaded chicken on a dinner roll, a bag of fruit snacks, and a box of juice. Eighteen dollars for this.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She must be rich.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Though she still complained, "This isn't much food for nine dollars, is it? I'm sorry, you'll probably still be hungry after eating this. I'll get you anything you like from the grocery store down the street, so please don't be angry."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>As long as I don't catch whatever that country-looking fellow from last night had from eating food that you bought, I won't be angry.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I was only here to hear her explanation for what happened last night, but she said it was bad manners to talk seriously while eating, and made me wait while she nibbled through her food like a squirrel, stopping every two nibbles to say something about one of the three classes that we had apparently shared for three weeks without my knowledge. I, meanwhile, had bolted down my food in fourteen seconds and took to pacing around the courtyard while she finished, unable to sit still next to an unearthly creature disguised as a good-looking sort of girl, even if doing so would have improved my standing around campus.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I even saw people staring at us.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Come on, it's not that weird to stand up and pace around while waiting for someone to finish eating.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Maybe I was more infamous than I'd thought.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Or maybe she was well-known.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Are you a celebrity around here?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I asked, figuring that if I was going to be killed, I was already dead anyway, so impudence was not something to be concerned over. Not that I was ever concerned over it anyway.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She looked up in mild surprise, a piece of red fruit snack stuck to the corner of her mouth. It was ridiculously moe-moe. I wondered if being moe-moe was some sort of survival mechanism for her. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>When bees find a good source of nectar, they get the attention of the others and fly around in different patterns to indicate whether the source is near or far.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>When rabbits hear the scream of a hawk, they pound their feet on the ground to warn the others inside the den.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Similarly, acting moe-moe might be a way to lure in country-looking fellows to suck the life out of. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>Though that would actually be closer to the behavior of the angler fish, which dangles a glowing ball at the end of an appendage on its head so that smaller, dumber fish come near, attracted by the light, and are promptly eviscerated by dozens of spear-like teeth.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>In any case, she responded to my question by saying, "No, not particularly. Not so far as I know, anyway. But you know, some people become celebrities without actually knowing it. They say that Walter Cronkite was amazed when he walked into a restaurant and the staff all knew who he was."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Did they say that?</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"So, I guess it's possible that I became a celebrity without being aware of it."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"In the end, celebrity is something that the celebrators create in their own minds," I commented. "Even if you know you're celebrated, if the celebrators stop celebrating, you can't make it continue just by being aware of it. So in the same way, you can't stop them from celebrating by being unaware of it."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"They also say 'Some are born great, some become great, and others have greatness thrust upon them'. We seem to be discussing the last case."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"They also say 'There are lies, damn dirty lies, and then there are statistics'."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I've also read that 'It's easy to lie with statistics, but it's easier to lie without them.'"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"But Confucius said, 'A fool lies about the truth, but a wise man lies about his lies.'"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>With that, she smiled, set aside her empty bag of fruit snacks, and said,</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I'm a succubus."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>as if it were a casual continuation of the meaningless exchange we had just been having.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>And I replied,</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I thought you were French. Is Succuba somewhere in French Polynesia?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"No, it's not an ethnicity. If it were, shouldn't it be 'Succuban' or 'Succubese'?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Then does it mean you're a member of the church of Succuba?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"That would also be 'Succuban', or maybe 'Succubic'."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"A member of the fourteenth tribe of Israel."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"That would be 'Succubite' or 'Succubine', and what happened to the thirteenth tribe?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Then you're a member of the Succube Party, a new third party in the political system."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I'm actually an Independent."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Then you're some kind of infinite-dimensional geometric figure with six faces."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I assure you I only exist in three space dimensions and one time dimension, and this is the only face I have."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Then you're some kind of new bus that sucks its riders into comfortable seats."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Sitting on me is actually pretty uncomfortable. Even my cat won't do it."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Then I give up. What are you—aside from someone with gooey, chewed up fruit snack on her face?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>With a shocked expression, she wiped around her chin with the back of her hand, then suddenly regained her decorum and, drawing a handkerchief from her purse, lightly dabbed her face clean.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"It's still there."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Deciding to do things properly this time, she walked over to the fountain nearby and looked at her reflection in the water. By the way, calling that pile of dirty old grout with water anemically trickling over it and running into the storm drain a fountain is pretty charitable, but at least it served for a mirror.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She returned to the bench, red-cheeked and moving in more rodent-like a manner than ever. "Anyway, please stop making this harder than it has to be."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I loved making things harder for inhuman creatures who were probably planning to kill me.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She continued.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I...was once human, but I was transformed into a creature who...who sucks the life out of men with sex."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"How much did that cost?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"It wasn't something I paid for! It wasn't even something I wanted. It was forced on me. It, well, it was during the French Revolution. I was attacked, and became something inhuman. Succubi are sort of like vampires; we eventually die if we don't feed, but we also feel burning hunger and pain if we go too long. But as long as we feed, we don't die—in fact, the amount of lifespan we get from feeding is proportional to how much longer the man we feed upon had to live."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"So you call it 'feeding'? It's just like scarfing down a chalupa to you?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"At this point, that's all it is. Just a shameful, necessary action."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"And your story sure did have a lot of holes in it."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Well, I won't pry. I don't more than half believe this anyway. If I were an inhuman creature that had to live by arbitrary rules, like a vampire, I would purposely spread around the wrong rules to confuse people and protect myself. Like that corpse with the paper in its pocket saying the Allies weren't attacking at Normandy that the Nazis found floating in the Atlantic.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>And I'd definitely tell everyone that I'd been traumatically forced to become whatever I was, so people would let down their guards and make it easier for me to eat them.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>But those downcast eyes were pretty convincing. And that miserable frown, like a child who's just accidentally pulled off Santa's beard after asking for eight hundred dollars worth of presents. She even somehow made her glasses mist over and took them off to wipe them.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Well, assuming she wasn't lying about the French Revolution, two hundred and fifty years was a lot of time to become a good actress.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I could probably take advantage of this.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>If she thought I believed her, she'd be in for a surprise when she tried to show her true colors.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It had to be convincing, though—I couldn't suddenly do a one-eighty from my previous, suspicious behavior.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Well, I have no better way to explain what I saw last night, so I guess I have to believe you," I said. "So is that why you approached me and said you were tired of Latrom too? Were you trying to suck the life out of me?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"No!"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She denied it vehemently.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"That definitely wasn't why I approached you—for one thing, I'd never feed on someone from the college. I don't want to be found and killed. Everything I said the other day was the truth."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Whether or not I believed that everything she had said was the truth, she had just said something I could not possibly ignore.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"If you don't feed on people from the college, what are you doing at this third-rate state college to begin with? Are you here for the nightlife? Then why bother sitting through these ridiculous classes?  Wouldn't you be happier somewhere where they have 'Soul-Sucking 10' and 'Chalupa Seduction 30'?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She somehow regained her composure. Rather, she probably faked losing her composure, then stopped faking and "regained" it. But either way, she smiled again.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Do I still have fruit snack on my face?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"No, you got it. Are you refusing to answer my question?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Do you mind if I answer using the Socratic Method?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I didn't particularly care what method she used—she could use the Spicolian Method of answering everything with "Huh?" for all I cared.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Okay. First, tell me why you're at this school."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"It's a long story."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Repay me, for my story."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"You haven't finished your story."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Make a down payment."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>If that was how she wanted to be, I would make sure I told a story that was so personal and so ridiculous that she could never turn it around on me with some callow response like "Yeah, same for me!" as she was surely planning to do.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"It all began in elementary school. I learned to read and write before I entered kindergarten, and everyone thought I was a boy genius and praised me. They were all expecting great things from me in the future. I tried my best to live up to their expectations and did my best in school. Then it happened."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"What?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I discovered that I was just too smart. I had surpassed even the gods themselves. Pallas Athene descended from Mount Olympus and stole all my books in envy of my intelligence, and I suffered twelve labors and twenty years of misfortune thanks to the wrath of Apollo. Even Odin got in on the act, and threw rotten lox at me from the back of his eight-legged horse, Sleipnir. I thought, what good is this genius which has brought the wrath of the gods upon me? So I started failing everything on purpose."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I don't more than half believe you," she said, echoing the exact thought I'd had several minutes before.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Whether you believe me or not, each and every word is true."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"There aren't any Greek gods."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Should a succubus be doubting the existence of the Greek gods? At least they have the advantage of having once been believed in by many people. In any case, throughout middle school, I failed everything on purpose. I came up with obnoxious ways to fail everything, like circling the obviously fake answer on a multiple choice exam, or writing that Malcolm X was the son of Crispus Attucks and he was angry that his father was killed in the Boston Massacre on a history exam."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"My parents, likewise doubting that the Greek gods were to blame, thought I was just bored and put me into an expensive private high school. I had enough respect for them to make an effort. For two and a half years I ground away at the college prep curriculum at that school. There were just two problems: I was still cursed by the gods, and the school was a Catholic school."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Why was that a problem?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I'm not Catholic."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I'm still not seeing the conflict."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Divinity studies were a required subject, and the teacher was a total fascist—made Latrom look like Abraham Lincoln. If it had just been about reading and remembering the Bible, it might've been all right, but at that school, you learn two versions of every subject: the regular version, and the version according to a literal interpretation of the Bible."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Oh, I see. You clashed with the teacher over creationism and the necessity of witch burning."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I knew a demonic, inhuman creature would understand."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"But you still made it into college, right?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Well, most of the people from that school made it into Yale or Columbia, and if I'd finished the track I was on, I might have made it too. After all, stupid people are a minority group, so some of us get into the Ivy League through affirmative action. But then they told me they were planning to hold me back a year because I answered a question on ethics that read 'Explain why God chooses to create strife in Muslim countries while Christian nations prosper' with 'Because he can be a real jerk sometimes', I decided I couldn't take it anymore and I asked my parents to switch me to the public high school."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Of course, I was still cursed by the Greek gods, so I went to the public high school and discovered that they didn't much like my kind over there. In fact, they would have preferred a dead opossum for a classmate, because that way they could at least eat it when they got sick of looking at it. So I spent most of my last two years of high school drunk, writing up plans for moving to Sweden so I could marry my little sister."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She winced.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She tried to hide it, but I could see it.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>So even demonic beasts have standards.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"In the last two months or so of high school, I discovered that not even Sweden will let you do that, so I devoted myself to finding somewhere our forbidden love could flourish, graduated high school with some miserably low GPA, worked at Best Buy for two years, decided I hated it, worked at Burger King for three months, decided I hated it even more, was nagged by my little sister for a month, decided I hated it slightly less than working at Burger King, and came here, because they would let in some jerk who graduated high school with a 1.9 GPA and then stacked TVs for two years, which nowhere else would."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I said too much.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>At the very least, I should have left out the part about marrying my sister.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>At least I didn't tell her that that was still an active research project.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>But she didn't look too disgusted. That was a surprise. Such a pathetic life should have been utterly contemptible for someone over two hundred years old. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>In fact, she almost looked satisfied.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Well, you asked why I'm here," she said. "It's basically that."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>How did she still manage to pull that trick on me?</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"There's no way you went through exactly the same thing I did. For one thing, they didn't even have Best Buy in the eighteenth century."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Of course it's not exactly like your story," she said. "But it's similar."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I came here because I had lots of spare time, and I thought I might as well learn something, she said.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>But why this college.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>At the very least, you should be able to get your PhD in French history and become an expert on the French Revolution.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>So why this college.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Well, let's just say I have my reasons for being in this town, and those reasons won't let me leave it, so it was this college or nothing."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>And why don't you already have a degree, after two hundred and fifty years?</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Women weren't even allowed into universities until the nineteenth century, and even then it was restricted for a long time. Remember Virginia Woolf? They wouldn't even let her walk on the grass."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Okay, after eighty years.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Actually, I didn't start attending college until the 1950s. My first time I was in the graduating class of 1954 at Illinois State University."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Okay, after...I quickly did some calculations. After approximately fifty years. I can't do calculations quickly.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Well, I've faked my own death several times and come back as someone else so I could earn another degree. I also spent a lot of time just auditing classes that sounded interesting."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Why do you need so many degrees.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"It's not as if I major in the same subject every time. My first degree was in French. I chose it because I thought it would be easy."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I'd think so.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"It wasn't. I hadn't used the language for seventy years. I'd been living in England for most of Victoria's reign. Also, I had to learn all the grammar. It was interesting, though. We read lots of Balzac and Voltaire, and some Rousseau. I read some Descartes on the side."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"In 1968 I graduated with a degree in history. I went all the way to a PhD with that one, so good guess."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>So you like history.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Not particularly. History isn't really history to me. It's more like what was in the newspapers yesterday, only go back seventy thousand yesterdays. I even taught it for a while. It's like when older people talk to younger people about their youth, and about what was different back then. That's how I felt when I taught history."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"In 1977 I graduated with a degree in physics."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>That's a pretty radical change.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Actually, I took my first physics class because I was trying to find out if my immortality would protect me from nuclear fallout. Of course, if all the people died, I'd have no one to feed on, so I'd eventually die anyway. But I was curious, so I took the class and ended up liking the subject somehow."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"In 1989 I graduated with a degree in computer science and electrical engineering. I was starting to feel pretty out of date, especially after the Apple II, so I went for something related to modern technology."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>So you became a computer nerd.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Don't call me a computer nerd. I'm proud to say that almost every single thing I learned with that degree was hopelessly outdated by 1994, and that the only way I could program a computer today would be if it were an IBM with an 8086 processor and a COBOL compiler."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Even knowing that makes you a computer nerd.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Don't call me a computer nerd, you news nerd."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>So with all those degrees (and possibly others that she forgot about) enumerated, I had only one question to ask her.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"You must have taken the general education courses ten or eleven times by now, so why are you doing it all again? Why are you taking economics, or suffering Latrom's rants?"</span><p class="standard"><span>"Actually, I think the more of a demagogue a teacher is, the more interesting he is."</span></p></p><p class="standard"><span>That's a pretty strange statement. And you just dissed all female teachers.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Because it's fun to see what demagoguery the demagogues are up to. In the 50s it was all about Communism. In the 60s it was all about drugs and nuclear disarmament. In the 70s it was all about free love. In the 80s it was all about stock options and homosexuals. Now it's taxes. It's just fun to watch them—it's like, the subjects change, but the rants stay the same."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>That was truly a statement worthy of an immortal being. Good job, I two-thirds believe you now.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Also, I need a proper course of general education for my degree in biology."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"You're telling me that a creature which defies all biological sense by doing something as absurd as draining the life from men through sex is studying for a degree in biology?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"That was hurtful. Are you calling me a fantastical creature that science cannot explain? How rude. Even after twenty years of marriage, a man can't just call a lady something like that."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Why did she seem to be enjoying herself?</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Maybe it was the death that awaited me at the end of this pointless conversation.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I'm sure even I can be explained biologically," she continued. "It's only that no one has ever tried, because no one has ever had a sample."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"So you're planning to experiment on yourself?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I'm not the only succubus in the world."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"So you're planning to da Vinci another succubus and find out what makes her tick?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I know someone who would do the actual cutting for me. And I'll stand over his shoulder with a notebook and make drawings, and sometimes I'll scratch my chin and sagely pronounce 'Fascinating. So that's how it works.' while looking as much like Mr. Spock as I can."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>You need pointy ears.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Actually, in my true succubus form, I have them."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>You need to buy a hairbrush.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"You saw me the other night, so you know that I own one."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>You need a Spandex uniform.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I have one."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Seriously?</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Anyway, I might have said above that I only had one question to ask her, but actually, that was a lie. There was something else she had said, or rather, it seemed likely she had let it slip, that I couldn't just ignore.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"How did you know that I maintain a news blog?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Ah. Did I say that?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"You did. You said 'Don't call me a computer nerd, you news nerd.' Computer nerd."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"That isn't how my voice sounds!"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She objected to my impression of her.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Really? I think it was a shocking likeness."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"And you called me a computer nerd again. If you're always like this, no girl will ever love you and you'll never be able to get married."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Can't be helped, I accepted that a long time ago. Besides, as long as I have Lucy, why should I want other girls?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"You can't plan to spend your life with your sister at such a young age! At least search for someone."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"See, you just did it again. You might have been able to infer from my earlier comments that Lucy is my sister, but most people would at least skip a beat while they figured that out. So tell me why you know these things about me when we've only spoken twice, computer nerd. Did you computer nerd your computer nerd into my computer nerd with your computer nerd, computer nerd?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Don't think that just hearing the word 'computer nerd' will affect me when it's not actually directed at me. Only two of those occurrences were directed at me, so I found only those two offensive."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Don't think you can dodge my probing questions and piercing insight forever, computer nerd."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"If I told you I typed your name into Google and found your blog, would you find that creepy?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Yes. Why did you do that?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"It's a secret."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"My sister's name isn't on Google."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"If I told you that I bribed someone in the registration office to give me your info, would you find that creepy?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Anyone would find that creepy. Why did you do that?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"It's a secret."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"When did you do all this?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"When you raised your hand and said 'Here' on the first day of Latrom's class."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Why?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"It's a secret. By the way, if I told you that I broke into your room at night and watched you sleep, would you find that creepy?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Incredibly so!"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Thank goodness I scratched that one off the list, then."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Again, why did she seem to be enjoying herself?</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Come to think of it, I'd never seen her talking to anyone in class. Not that I'd been watching her particularly closely.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"That's actually why I came to talk to you the other day. I read your blog, and I thought it was good. I did some background research on some of the stories you broke and found out that some major national newspapers picked up that one on the gang problem in small towns."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I almost died on that one. No <span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1">New York</span><span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1">Times </span>reporter would almost die for a story like that, so it was convenient for them."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"And the Sacramento <span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1">Bee </span>printed that one you did about bullying."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"That was written from personal experience. I was bullied by four senior girls at the Catholic high school. They tied me down and forced me to do erotic things for them."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"So I was intrigued. I doubt very many people at this college have done anything as amazing as those stories. It seemed like Latrom and the other students should have some respect for you, but they all treated you like the Jew of Malta."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"You could have just said a leper."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I saw how they treated lepers. They wouldn't have let you sit in the same room with everyone."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Why bring the Jews into this?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Ignoring my protest against her eighteenth century anti-Semitism, she went on. "From this treatment, I saw two possible conclusions: either none of them had even the slightest idea that you had written those stories, or you were such an egotistical jerk that they couldn't stand you no matter how amazing you were. When you stood up to Latrom that day and stormed out of the classroom, it seemed like the perfect excuse to talk to you and find out."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Don't say I stormed out, that makes it sound like I was throwing a tantrum."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"You were throwing a tantrum."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I was righteously angry that this college would employ someone with no respect for the integrity of the text."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"And why would that be? Because your respect for John Donne ran so deep? I think it's because you were thinking about how you'd feel if someone did that to your own text, that you risked your life to put together. You were thinking about someone taking your gang story and, say, claiming it supported the idea of martial law in certain low-income neighborhoods."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I don't have morals like that. Don't do literary analysis on my motives."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She laughed and flipped back her hair. It was an enchanting gesture. I even thought that being killed by a graceful creature like this might not be so bad. As long as I didn't suffer. I couldn't stand the idea of suffering.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"You know, the first time we talked, I was starting to suspect you might have become an outcast because of option (b). You're doing your best to make it seem that way, anyway. But let me ask: have you ever even hinted to anyone in this school that you run a small local news blog that might be of some interest to someone?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I yelled it off the roof of the auditorium on the first day of class, but not that many people heard because the campus police dragged me down after about fifteen minutes."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"And what motive could you have for not telling anyone?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"It would be like casting pearls before swine. There you have it, option (b). So now that I know your secret and you know I'm a jerk, please just tell me whether you're planning to kill me. If you're planning to sex me to death, you should know that I'm a pathetic virgin who never even touched a woman's hair until I grabbed yours earlier, so you shouldn't expect too much out of me in that way, though you'll probably get some nice life force from me. If you're planning to slit my throat, would you mind hitting me in the head from behind with a big rock first so I don't feel anything?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I'm not going to kill you."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Damn, I was looking forward to my first sexual experience, even if I was going to die three seconds later."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I told you I'd never feed on anyone at the college. It would be too obvious. People would miss you. Your sister would miss you. She would, right?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She would.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Even if she wouldn't admit it.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"So, since I won't kill you, I'm pretty much at your mercy. If you want, you can turn me in. There are vigilante groups who hunt my kind. They'd kill me right away, so you could tell them I'm here if you want."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It was tempting.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Before you decide to take that option, I want you to know that that man from last night was a murderer. He picked up a woman hitchhiking and beat her to death with a hammer. He was bragging about it in the bar. It's why I picked him."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Her glasses were misting up again.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I was once human, so I don't want to kill other humans. But I try my best to live well. I try to help others, I try not to get in anyone's way, to be useful. That man didn't. I took his life to continue my own. I think my life is more valuable than his. But if you think that's too great a crime, then I'll submit to your morality and let you turn me in. I won't kill you to protect myself, because you haven't done anything wrong."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Nice speech.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"By the way, if that wasn't enough to convince you, I can still do things with my mouth and hands without taking any of your life force."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>You suddenly cheapened it at the end.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>But really, all this was too much. Her whole act—the story of being brutally turned into a succubus against her will, her claim of being at my mercy, the downcast eyes, the misting glasses—it was all too much. I was even starting to doubt that she was conning me to later kill me.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>That was dangerous.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Constant vigilance, as Mad-Eye Moody would say.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I sat down on the edge of a concrete planter across from the bench where she still sat. staring at me with an entreating look in her eyes. A look that said <span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1">Please, I will do anything...</span></span></p><p class="standard"><span>A dangerous look.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I considered carefully how to proceed.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The smartest thing to do would be to turn her in, like she said. If these groups that ran around killing succubuses really existed, then I should go straight over there and tell them there was a succubus living in our midst and I had seen her suck the life from a man.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>But, well, even I'm not completely amoral. If she was killed, I might have saved my own hide and my chastity, but I would always be tortured by doubts. Was she really conning me, I would wonder. Could she have been telling the truth. Had I killed a sort of innocent creature of darkness.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>As a reporter, I couldn't stand doubts. I had to know everything.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>So I said this.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I don't know if I believe everything you've said, but if I were you and I were going to kill me, I would've done it last night, or at least before buying me lunch and talking to me for forty-five minutes. You're clearly something that defies everyday common sense, I saw that for myself last night, and I really can't confirm whether that guy whose life you sucked out deserved it or not, but I don't think you deserve to die. At least, based on what I know so far."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I might still find myself bleeding out in the parking lot with a sniper rifle bullet in my back.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>But if I did, I would die without any doubts.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Her face, the face of the creature that called itself Sophia de Nuit, broke into a smile at my words, and her glasses started misting up so badly that she excused herself to the ladies' room to clean them. She came back and flashed me a row of perfect, straight white teeth.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Her canines were a little long.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>A little fang-like.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I was considering this last night, after you saw me," she said, the relief in her voice palpable. "And I decided that, if you would show me mercy, I would put myself further into your debt by asking for your help."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>They say bad things always come in threes. I guessed this was the second one.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I'm willing to do anything I can to repay you, and I can do some things that no human could."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Thanks, but I'm not really interested in the oral sex thing."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She shook her head and held up her hands palm outward, as if to ward me off. "Oh, no, that was just me trying to save myself. Um, please forget I ever said it, if you can."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Anyway, ask me what you need help with. If I can do it, I'll help. Oh, but you can't live with me. My parents don't even want me there, so I can't start bringing in succubuses and stuff."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"No, nothing like that. I'm trying to find out about someone who lives around here. I think he might be an incubus—the male version of a succubus—and I need more information to confirm. But he's very embedded in the community, and I'm not from around here, so I'm having a hard time getting people to talk to me."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"So you think I might have more luck investigating this guy."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"That's right. Please?" She brought her hands together beseechingly, once again looking ridiculously moe-moe.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"What's this guy's name?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Joseph Austen. He's a local pastor at the World of Light Church."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>What an incredible coincidence.</span></p>

        <p class="standard"><span>After that, we talked for at least two hours, but much of it was drivel, like the drivel that liberally slopped down over the conversation you've just read, so I'll pass over the exact words and relay only the most important details.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I told her I was already investigating Joseph Austen.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She applauded me and said, "As expected of James Moran! So you were already aware that he was suspicious. I also have to investigate people often, but I only follow orders, so I think it would pretty hard if you had to decide for yourself whether someone needs to be checked out. That's pretty amazing."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I tried not to let it go to my head, but it was hard with her.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She was just so damned, so damned likable.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>So hard to dislike</span></p><p class="standard"><span>So easy to feel positively towards.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Having this cute, intelligent, slightly ditzy woman in front of me even made it hard to be afraid of the life-stealing creature in the red dress I had seen last night.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>That was the scariest part of all.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I told her what information I had gathered so far. She added two major pieces to what I had discovered:</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I said before that an incubus is like a male succubus, but that isn't really true. They do have the same ability to entrance humans as us, but they don't need to take life force from humans to live. If an incubus, er, spends the night with a willing human woman, she'll give birth to a demon child, like that girl Amber described."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I asked what she meant by 'willing'.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Well, it's hard to say for sure, because no one can know exactly what someone was thinking at the moment she was with an incubus, but if she feels positively towards him when they're together, she'll usually have a demon childbirth. From what you say, that girl Amber felt like she was repaying Austen's favor when they were together."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>What happens if she doesn't feel positively towards the incubus?</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Well, I'm sorry to say that you're looking at the result of that."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Hah. Sorry for your loss.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Don't talk about it like my cat died or something."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The second major piece of information was this:</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Incubi can impregnate men. Don't ask me how it works. After I finish my degree in biology, I'll da Vinci one and we can find out. But I've seen it happen. In the old days, the demon child would tear through the man when it was ready to be born, but it sounds like those boys got into the hospital and had them surgically removed."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"By the way, men can't become succubi, but I'm not sure how it works beyond that," she added.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>So that made it pretty much a done deal: Austen was a child-molesting incubus. Since all these kids trusted him, he was able to sex them up and implant them with demon children. No telling what the boys' parents had done with their little bundles of joy, but from the sound of it, they could walk within minutes of birth and would go out looking for something to kill and eat as soon as they could walk, so it was doubtful that Amber's demon child had died from being left at the edge of the trailer park.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Now the question was what to do about it.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The police weren't likely to help.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I'd told Amber the police department was full of people wanting to become heroes by busting a child-molester, but that was a lie. I'd seen inside the Santa Robles police department.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It tended to be soft on the locals, and even softer on anyone affiliated with religion. Austen was both.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Publishing a story was likely to be even more of an uphill battle.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>As a last resort, I had asked our friendly neighborhood succubus if she could do anything about this, but she had said, "Sorry, I think what he's doing is terrible, but I can only act according to the rules, and the rules won't let me do anything in this situation." and forfeited all responsibility.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>So as I walked towards the next bus stop in the darkness of early evening, having missed my usual bus because somebody couldn't stop blathering (oh wait, that was me), I thought about what to do.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Apparently she lived in town somewhere, so she had walked with me to the corner of Vine Way and Holly Avenue before splitting off and leaving me to think about how to solve this.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>A human's problems were simple. A succubus could easily solve them, just as a first-grader's problems were simple and could easily be solved by an adult.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>But in the end, a first-grader has to solve a first-grader's problems, and a human has to solve a human's problems. Putting aside the issue of the demon children, Austen was a human problem.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Of course, a human could also solve a succubus's problem. I had solved her problem by giving her my information, but when I pointed this out to her, she said, "I'm extremely grateful for that, and I'll certainly find some way to show my gratitude, but I can't go outside the rules. I'm sorry." and procrastinated the day when she would have to pay me back, like someone charging up a credit card and then making only the minimum payment.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>If a human could solve a succubus's problems, it stood to reason that a human could solve an incubus's problems.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Or rather, a group of humans.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Like the group of humans surrounding me right now.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"You James?" one of them asked. "You da fool been gettin all in Pastor Austen's bidniss?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I guessed they weren't just a bunch of overzealous Sunday School teachers.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Rather, I knew, from their red armbands, that they were with one of the local street gangs.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>By the way, you may have gotten the impression that that guy who asked for my name was African-American, from the way he spoke. That was not the case. He was, in reality, far whiter than me. When I didn't immediately answer his question, he approached me, thrusting his milky white cheeks, covered with freckles, towards me in a threatening manner. His close-shaved ginger red hair allowed an even more pale scalp to shine through like a full moon, and there were freckles all up and down the arms he raised to make some rap gesture at me.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>By the way, all five of his cohorts, two of whom were standing by his side in front of me and two of whom had somehow gotten behind me at some point, were Hispanic.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It seems that even in gangs, minorities have a hard time getting promoted to management positions.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"No, my name is Steve," I said, finally answering the question.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I didn't really expect them to believe me, but I had to try.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Nah, you James," said the great white hope. "I seen a pitcha."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>This was the second time today I had discovered that someone I didn't want knowing anything about me had discovered things about me.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It wasn't a pleasant feeling, but I figured the beating I was about to receive if I couldn't escape these guys would feel even more unpleasant.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>By the way, I don't fight. I never have. When I was younger, my sister handled the fights. She took jujitsu from a young age and was a second-degree black belt by the time she was fourteen. My job was always more of a supporting role. I would watch her trash some guys and then make fun of them because they got trashed by a girl four years (or more) younger than they were.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Unfortunately, she was in New York right now, along with her second-degree black belt in jujitsu.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>And I was here, surrounded by five gang bangers.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Still, I had done that gang story, as that computer nerd succubus insisted on reminding me, so it wasn't like I had never talked to people like this before. Of course, that experience just reinforced how hopeless it was to think I could talk my way out of this situation; guys like this were usually friendly enough if you were on their good side, but if you weren't, they weren't about to give you a chance to get on it.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I tried anyway.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Listen, man, I never did anything to you guys," I ventured. "I got no problem with you." I looked around at all of them, hoping that even if the great white hope wouldn't listen, one of the others might.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>No dice.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Why're you guys working for Joseph Austen anyway?" I asked. "You know he bangs little kids? He's a sicko?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Man, I don't give no half shit 'bout none a that, so long as I gettin paid," said the great white hope, killing off all of my hopes. "An' I be gettin paid to make sure you don't never get up in Austen's bidness again, know what I'm sayin?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I did know what he was saying.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>And so did the rest of them, since they started closing in around me.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Plan B.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I took out my camera. "This camera is connected to the Internet," I said. "If I take pictures of you, it'll go straight to my computer. My family knows about it. They'll bring the pictures to the cops."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>That was a lie. The camera <span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1">was </span><span class="T2">hooked up like that, a practice I began after hostile players in stories I was covering destroyed my first few cameras to keep the pictures inside from being released. But no one in my family knew about it, except for Lucy, the computer literate one, and she was in New York.</span></span></p><p class="standard"><span>Also, if I got beat up and died or went to the hospital, then rather than rushing off to find those did it, my mother might just welcome the greatly diminished long-distance bill.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>In any case, my lie didn't accomplish anything, because one of the four henchmen laughed at me, and the great white hope looked like he'd tuned out at the word 'camera'.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Plan C.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I ran for it.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I didn't make it far, because one of the two thugs behind me, probably using skills he honed as a basketball point guard, got in front of me and knocked me on my ass. I tried to scramble to my feet, but  the other guy behind me grabbed the collar of my shirt and threw me down onto my chest, sprawled on the pavement.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Well, that's it. I'm out of ideas. I'm dead.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Goodbye, world. Sorry we never got along better. All I ask for is the opportunity to float around as a ghost long enough to see Lucy cry at my funeral. I hope she remembers to read that Thomas Gray poem I like.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>While thinking such things, I was unexpectedly saved.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Hey boys. What're you doing over there with him? Come over here."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Through the saggy jean-clad legs of one of my attackers, I could see that computer nerd succubus, who ran off on her own after doing weird things to me, further back on the sidewalk. As creepy as she was, having bribed the registrar's office to get information about me, I wouldn't be surprised if she'd been following me. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>Still, if she wanted to sex all the life from these guys, at this moment, I wasn't about to complain. Though right now, they didn't seem like they'd be interested.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Wait, they seemed completely interested.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The great white hope had already left. After she took off her glasses, the others left as well, like they'd totally forgotten about beating me up. The great white hope must have a glasses fetish.</span></p><p class="standard"><span class="T2">They begin to cluster around her, as they had been clustered around me a second ago, but before </span><span class="T2">they could enclose her, she turned around and sauntered off, her hair trailing out behind her, and I couldn't tell if it was a trick of the setting sun, but it didn't look mousy brown; it looked fiery red. The five thugs fell into line behind her, like a bunch of orphans following their headmistress.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>As she had turned, however, she had shot me a glance and waved her hand in a gesture that couldn't possibly mean anything other than "go away".</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I had every intention of doing so.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>But what a frightening combo attack. Irresistible pheromone attraction paired with death sex. With just a few words those tough gang bangers had been following her around like little ducklings. I understood a little how pointless my cagey attitude towards her had been. If she'd really wanted to suck my life force, then my vigilance couldn't have stopped her, no matter how constant it might be.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>As I boarded a bus towards home, I thought that I really needed to stop walking through the nightlife area after dark. This was the second time in as many days that I'd been in mortal danger coming through here.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>When I got home, I looked around the Internet and made a few calls, looking for any information on a pale ginger-headed street gang leader. It turned out he was fairly well known. His real name was Jared Burns, but on the street, he was known as JZ. He led a cell of about thirty gangsters and had been in county jail twice for drugs and on probation once for illegally carrying a concealed weapon. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>Thirty gangsters. So he could have just sent five guys. Why did he go through the trouble of coming out himself? Did he really want to punch me that badly?</span></p><p class="standard"><span>No, it was probably the money. If Austen had only agreed to pay the ones who actually carried out the attack, JZ would've wanted his piece of it. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>After that, I bugged my sister for a while.</span></p><p class="standard"><span class="T2">"So, let me have it. What's your angle this time?" she said immediately, without greeting. "You know, if you go with the von D</span><span class="T3">ä</span><span class="T4">nniken hypothesis, you could just postulate that the Anu-Naki brought a copy of </span><span style=" font-family:Times New Roman; font-style:italic; " class="T5">Kanon </span><span class="T4">back to the Elizabethan Age and let Shakespeare play it on their rock-based computer."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>With all the commotion today, I had completely forgotten about working on my notes. "Oh, sorry. I don't have anything for you."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Well, I won't complain. So did you call to have a normal conversation, or did you want to creep me out? I'm game for either tonight."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She always gets all lovey-dovey when I don't call her for a day or two.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It's one of her cute points.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Actually, I want to ask your advice," I said.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Is this related to that weird text you sent me the other night, about birth-control pills and cigarettes?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Now that you mention it, it sort of is."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"When you said 'young' girl, how young did you mean? Did you fall in love with one of Mia's classmates?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Even I'm not perverted enough to go after seven-year-olds," I said.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I wouldn't sound so confident, there are some pretty sexy seven-year-olds out there these days..."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Yeah, but all suffer from the defect of not being you."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Waves of creepification are running down my spine. So, on what matter do you seek advice, young one? The mysteries of puberty? The blossoming of desire? Come on, I can't wait to hear it."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Have you ever heard of Pastor Joseph Austen?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span class="T4">My sister went silent for a moment. "Yeah. When I worked at the summer camp, he came around a few times. He always gave me a strange feeling, like someday he was going to show up in the </span><span style=" font-family:Times New Roman; font-style:italic; " class="T5">20/20 </span><span class="T4">pedophile house. Kind of like you."</span></p><p class="standard"><span class="T4">I smiled, both at my sister's unwittingly apt characterization of Joseph Austen and her insult to </span><span class="T4">my person. "I've been investigating him recently for a story about exactly that sort of thing."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Well, I can't say I'm surprised."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I spoke to one of his victims. She's the young girl I mentioned."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Please don't tell me you were hoping she would fall in love with you and let you take her away from all that."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Nothing like that, but I did sort of feel like I wanted to do something for her."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>My sister's voice disappeared.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>After approximately five seconds, it reappeared.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"You're serious?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I was surprised myself. But if you'd seen the place she lives in, maybe you'd understand."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"No, I understand the idea of wanting to help someone. It's you understanding it that I don't understand."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>So, in order to enlighten my sister in some small way as to the motives behind this feeling, I told her a little about my visit to the trailer park. But as expected from her, she didn't let herself succumb to emotion and remained objective, saying,</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I see why you feel that way, and I know I'll sound horrible for saying this, but don't do it. Don't get involved any more with that girl—Amber, was it?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Ah, are you jealous? Don't worry, Lucy, no one will ever replace you."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Stop that! I'm being serious. Hearing about this girl gives me a bad feeling, and I'm not speaking in terms of some abstract intuition. If she grew up somewhere like that and survived, she probably knows how to work people. I'm afraid she was playing you. For all we know, she played Austen, and if that's true, now he's the one being investigated as a child molester and she came out smelling like a rose. So please, try to ignore this awakening of the charitable spirit and spare yourself the danger."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I waited a few beats. "If you really feel that way, I guess I can't ignore it," I said. "I don't want to make my cute little sister worry, so I'll do as you say."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"For you, that was almost nice."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>After that, we talked for a while about <span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1">Fruits Basket </span>and Voltaire, until it was Lucy's bedtime and she had to leave. I felt reinvigorated from talking to her, as if my spirit had been healed.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Even though I also felt ashamed for what I just did to her.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I'm sorry, Lucy. I had already made up my mind.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I just used you to confirm my own opinion.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I didn't want to face it, so I had you say it for me.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>You and I are too similar, so I knew you'd come to the same conclusion I did.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Thinking such things, I went to bed.</span></p>

      <div id="chaptertext">
        <p class="standard"><span>I ditched Latrom's class the next day.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I had assumed that computer nerd succubus would want to talk about what happened last night as soon as possible, so I waited in the corner of the library where she had come looking for me twice now. I had half expected her to be there already when I arrived, but when she wasn't, I didn't think it could be long before she appeared.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I waited four hours.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>When she appeared, her chaotic mousy brown hair dammed up behind a white headband, an uncute denim Mennonite skirt around her waist and a plain white blouse around her shoulders, I asked where she had been, and she, in a tone of surprise, said she was in class. I wanted to shake her and ask why she spent four hours going to hear Latrom give his idiotic views on poetry whose writers she had been alive to meet, but I now knew how easily she could kill me, so I asked why she spent four hours going to hear Latrom's idiotic views on poetry whose writers she had been alive to meet without shaking her.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Don't get angry," she said. "I was expecting you to come to class. I was going to speak with you there."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>...It seemed we had misunderstood each other in a particularly stupid fashion.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Well, now that you are here, what have you got to say for yourself, you first kiss-stealing computer nerd succubus?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Why should I say anything for myself? You're the one who was nearly beaten and needed to be rescued, then ran away before I could come back to talk to you. Why don't you say something for yourself?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>...She was right.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Being rescued by your sister is one thing, but when the rescuer is an infernal creature whose acquaintance you've only just recently made, the proper etiquette must be used.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>But first,</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"What do you mean, ran away before you could come back? I thought you were signaling me to run away!"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I meant, run away to somewhere safe and wait for me."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"How am I supposed to know that?!"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She looked thoughtful. "I was sure I had imprinted my scent pattern on you. You really didn't get my meaning at all? That's strange, it should have worked. Well, I've never done it before, so I guess I need some practice."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Is that why you attacked me and stole my sacred first kiss that I was saving for Lucy?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"That was one reason."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"You're terrible! How do you live with yourself? Rather, how am I supposed to live with you, knowing you have mind control and death sex powers?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I hadn't expected to be so angry. My intention had been to exchange information with her and then leave, but somehow I was experiencing a delayed panic from the incident last night—because I had almost been beaten up, but also because succubuses were damn scary—and now I was taking it out on her.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She seemed to understand somehow, because she said this:</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I'm sorry. I know you were almost attacked last night, and I know being around someone like me takes a little adjustment, but please don't be angry anymore. I know seeing someone using inhuman abilities can be off-putting, but they came in handy last night, didn't they?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>...She was right.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"...Thank you," I said grudgingly.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"You are most welcome, O'Neill."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Are you Jaffa now too? A Jaffa succubus? Is that headband hiding a gold-infused tattoo?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Actually, I'm not wearing anything under this headband."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"...Is that supposed to be sexy?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Some men find a bare head quite erotic."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Most of them are Amish."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"By the way, you say that I was alive to meet the poets we're reading, but it's not as if I actually met them. They were like celebrities. Meeting someone like Percy Shelley or Lord Byron would have been like meeting Charles Bronson today."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Did you actually just use Charles Bronson as an example?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"He's not popular anymore, is he?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Not particularly."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Celebrities go in and out of fashion so quickly ever since mass media, I have trouble keeping up with them. In my lifetime, I've probably forgotten more celebrities than even Joan Rivers knows."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"So you know of Joan Rivers, but you couldn't think of any actor more recent than Charles Bronson."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"It's actually pretty depressing when you think about it. I've had four lifetimes' worth of life, and I've still never managed to become a star. I remember when I saw <span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1">Cleopatra</span><span class="T2">, I wanted to be just like Elizabeth Taylor, but they didn't have color contacts back then, so I figured out how to use my powers to turn my eyes violet. But when I went in to audition, they told me I couldn't act."</span></span></p><p class="standard"><span>"You're surprisingly easy to influence, aren't you."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Somehow I always end up blathering when I'm with this girl. I think she makes it happen on purpose.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Anyway, enough of that. What happened to those guys last night? Did you kill them all with sex?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"No! I may have sex to feed, but I would never do it with five men in a row, like some assembly line!"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Actually, the image I had was more of a gang bang..."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Though to her it would be more like a dessert buffet.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I led them into an alley and left them there."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"How did you get away? They were all twitterpated and following you around."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I ran."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Huh."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Somehow I had expected a more succubus-like answer. One that involved more use of infernal powers. One not so mundane.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"More importantly, who were they?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"You didn't hear?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"It's not as if I arrived and then stood around listening, waiting for them to start hitting you."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I told her what I had discovered last night about JZ and his gang. "They'd been paid by Austen to threaten me and make me stop investigating," I finished.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"That girl Amber must have told him, don't you think? Or do you suspect the housewife?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>No, I didn't suspect Mrs. Sullivan.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I knew it was Amber.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>That was why I had called Lucy last night and told her what was going on.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Because I wanted to see Amber as a victim, I hadn't wanted to face the facts.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I didn't want to believe that she had betrayed me like that.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Betrayed...that word implied some level of trust existed, but honestly, there hadn't been any. I hadn't trusted Amber, and I doubted she had trusted me. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>So this wasn't really a betrayal.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It was a reversal of expectations.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>And I had needed to hear someone else tell me that such a reversal of expectations was not only possible, but likely, when dealing with someone like Amber who had led a life where trust was a liability.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"What will you do?" Sophia asked me.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Those guys weren't just going to bother you with leaflets. They were serious. You might have died, she said. Maybe you should consider giving up the investigation. Just disappear from Austen's radar.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I would like to. I've been a worthless son, a worthless brother, a bother to everyone. I don't want to make anyone sad if something happens to me. I would like to give up.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>But I have doubts.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>That's why I went to Harrington Hills, to see Amber again.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>When I told this to Sophia, that computer nerd succubus grinned at me with those satanic first kiss-stealing lips and said "Well, do your best and try not to get hurt. I'm really cheering for you, you know. Watching and talking to you has been the most fun thing I've done in almost eight years."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Apparently I was entertaining for her.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I had spent my whole life as an ostracized weirdo, so as strange as it sounds, I was sort of flattered to find that I was someone who was fun to be around by succubus standards.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It was like spending your whole life as the most hideous duck in the pond, so ugly that other ducks shudder when they look at you, only to discover that in vulture world you were Jude Law.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>And so I left the school, and headed for Harrington Hills, with the notion that I was the Jude Law (or maybe more like the Jack Black) of succubuses to buoy my spirit and make me feel that life was worth living. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>This time, I didn't bother talking to any of the people lying in the mud near the front, but instead headed straight for the car graveyard at the back of Harrington Hills to look for Amber.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>And I found her, in the same car she'd been in last time.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Holding a bundle of white blankets.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Cradling it.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I knocked on the window.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Oh, it's you," said Amber. She didn't seem surprised to see me.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Austen sent some guys after me last night to teach me not to get involved with his 'bidness'. I don't know how he found out who I am so quickly, but there's only one way he could've known to look."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"You think I told him?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I do."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I did."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I know."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>We stared at each other for a second through the open door of the rusted hulk. I looked over her pretty blue eyes, her fair hair, the attractive curve of her lips. It was such a shame. She shouldn't be here, Austen's plaything. She should be in the suburbs having brainless fun with her friends, looking forward to a bright future, like my sister Sue. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>Sorry, Lucy. I know what I said, but I can't leave it alone. I have to try one more time.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I'm not angry."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I'd be angry if somebody stabbed me in the back. But you aren't like me. You were brought up right, huh? A rich little kid from the 'burbs."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I don't blame you."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I don't care who you wanna blame."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Has Austen told you what he is?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Amber shifted the bundle of blankets in her arms. "I figured it out he ain't human."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I know he didn't force you. You said you gave birth to some sort of monster. If he'd forced you, you would've become like him. But since you were willing, you had the child. From that, I know he didn't force you, and I know he's the only person who ever took care of you, and I know I'm just a stranger who showed up one day, so I understand why you told him. But if you don't like what he's doing—if you don't like it even a little, even if you're fine with it but you don't like what he's doing to the other children, then come with me to the police station. I know some people in the police department. We can make sure he never does what you don't like again, and we can make sure you're protected."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Amber didn't answer. She looked away, down at the bundle, and swayed it a little.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I couldn't say whether I was getting through to her.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I doubted it.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>But I had to try.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"What's in the bundle?" I asked, already knowing the answer.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"After I left that creature in one of the cars, I went home. I was fine for a while, until I just started crying for no reason. Then I went back for him. After all, he was my baby. My firstborn baby."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I made a little nursery for him in the back of a minivan. He nursed for about three days, so much that my nipples hurt. He could walk after a week, and he wouldn't nurse anymore. He wanted raw meat. Austen made sure he got it. Austen made him a nice little room in the church after he found out. But I can go see him whenever I want to. Because he's my baby."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It happened too fast.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The bundle of white blankets burst open, and I found myself staring at the monkey-like face of what had been inside. It grinned at me with rows of sharp teeth poking through its lips, its pallid grey skin covered in a thin layer of wiry black hair.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>And it had a tail.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I found that out later, by the way. It had a long, monkey-like tail with a very not monkey-like stinger at the end. I didn't have a chance to find out, because it sprang at me, grabbed onto my shirt, and stuck the stinger between my ribs before I react.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>My head was swimming.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>My side was throbbing.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I wanted to throw up.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The monkey-like creature dropped away from me and scurried back to Amber. I stumbled away, dimly aware that I had fallen into a trap.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Sorry, Lucy. You were right, as usual.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Sorry again.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>That's what I thought as I passed into unconsciousness.</span></p>

        <p class="standard"><span>I still wanted to throw up.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>But I bravely resisted.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>After all, when you haven't eaten anything and you throw up, you're drawing on an empty account and bouncing all of your vomit checks. As a penalty, you have to put up with that lurching, heaving feeling in your stomach. I really wasn't into that right now, so I resisted the urge to throw up.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I could feel splinters and grit beneath me, and surmised that I was lying on a wood floor. It was dark, and I could smell the coolness of dew from somewhere, so I guessed that I'd been unconscious for a couple hours and night had fallen.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I didn't seem to be tied up or bound in any way, so I pushed myself to my knees, and felt a wave of pain smite my head. Despite that, I bravely got to my feet, felt another wave of pain smite my head, stumbled, and caught myself.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I'm full of courage today.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I wanted to look around and find out where I was, but it was dark and I couldn't see, so I couldn't do much but stand there in the middle of the dirt-covered wood floor.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Long I stood there, wondering, fearing, doubting.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Until I heard the hinges of a door creak, and a bare lightbulb dangling from the roof lit up a circle about eight feet in diameter in the center of the room.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I moved into the light.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Hello, James," said a voice I had never heard, though I could guess who owned it.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Joseph Austen.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>He was shorter than I expected, just about five feet six inches. His curly hair was greased back, revealing a high forehead, and he wore a light grey suit, and as he stepped down the rickety wooden stairs into what I assumed was the church basement, he let his wingtips fall with ominous slowness, until I asked if he was walking so slowly because he was arthritic.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Then he scurried down quickly enough.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I hear you've been looking into my affairs, James," said Austen. "Are you with the media?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I'm with the new media."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Surely you'll appreciate the tenuousness of your position. I am a respected member of this community. You are a nosy child playing with your computer. If you were to suddenly stop playing with your computer, who would notice?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Are you trying to threaten me? Are you Don Corleone? Are you trying to make me an offer I can't refuse? Yeah, you paid JZ to beat me up, but you're a pastor from a nothing town in the Sierra foothills, not a mob boss. You can't make me disappear. You might notice I'm still here, despite the best efforts of your hired thugs. Soon I'll release the story, and you'll be finished. I can already see the headlines—'Trusted pastor molests parishioners' children. Super-reporter James Moran uncovers story.' All I'm worried about now is making sure I don't get pregnant from any attempted gay rape."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I said.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>When actually, I was scared out of my wits.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I wanted to cry.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I wanted to talk to Lucy.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I'd even settle for an economics lecture from Pandit.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Anything to be somewhere other than here.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Austen was smiling.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Never a good sign when you're completely in the bad guy's power and he's smiling.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Don't worry about that. You're far too <span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1">old </span><span class="T2">for my taste, James. But my children need fresh food every so often. They can't live forever on dead things."</span></span></p><p class="standard"><span>As if turned on by another switch, dozens of pairs of glowing red orbs appeared in the darkness around me, blinking, winking. I could hear heavy breathing and slobbering.</span></p><p class="standard"><span class="T2">I could see the outline of a very large humanoid shape behind one pair of glowing orbs. Lanky, </span><span class="T2">long limbs. Arms and legs thick with muscle. Eight feet tall. Eight.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Pallid grey skin. Wiry black hair.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Rows of sharp teeth, grinning at me.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Monkey-like tail. Stinger.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>This must be what baby monkey grew up to be.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I wondered if it could fish for termites with a blade of grass.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>As more shapes began to fade in around me, I realized that I had one chance to escape.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The single door. Only Austen was standing in front of it. As wimpy as I am, Austen was shorter and older than me. I should be able to take him by surprise, knock him over, and get through the door.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>So I thought.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>But as soon as I made a dash for it and Austen, rather than trying to stop me, stepped aside and let me go, I knew it was futile.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I leaped to the top of the stairs and twisted the doorknob.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It went nowhere.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Do you take me for an imbecile? Of course I locked the door when I came in," said Austen.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Well, here we go. It's really it this time. I'll try smashing my shoulder into the door a few times, but I don't expect I can break through it. I'm done. Eaten by demonic monkey creatures with stingers. Austen will probably rape my corpse just to get back at me for making fun of him.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Then I heard a soft voice.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Not Austen's. A woman's. Through the door.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Get away from the door!"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I did, just in time; the door flew open so hard it almost came off its rusted, squeaky hinges, and in sauntered the last thing you'd ever expect to see in a church.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It was a sexy girl in her underwear.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Well, she had long, flaming red hair, and her eyes were gold and seemed to be glowing, and were those wings? Yes, big bat-like wings sticking straight out of her back. But her most prominent features were her sexiness and her in-her-underweariness. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>Although now that I looked, her underwear wasn't very sexy.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It had strawberries on it.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Seems you don't smell very well," she said to Austen. "I've marked this male. He's my prey. If you wish to feed him to your bastard children, you'll have to contend with me."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Interrupting her cool speech, I asked the question whose answer most interested me at the moment.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Why are you in your underwear?" I asked.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Why am I—is that the first thing you focus on?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"And it's got strawberries on it."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Because! Because, you can't expect me to fight in that skirt, can you? I'm in my underwear for you, idiot! Be grateful!"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>...She got mad.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>But there was no mistake that I was grateful to this computer nerd succubus for being in the area when I needed rescuing, again, for the second time. Although—</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"And what do you mean, you marked me? You were planning to sex me to death after all, weren't you?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Just shut up and let me save you!" she screamed.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Austen had been strangely quiet during our pointless exchange. He stared at the succubus with a wary expression. I had seen it before. It was the look that eighth-grade bullies had gotten when they were bullying me and my sister suddenly showed up. A look that meant ego and sense were arguing over the wisdom of fighting the recently entered person, with ego arguing that they couldn't back down and sense arguing that they couldn't win.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Good evening. I smelled no trace of the scent of one of my kind," said Austen. "Please accept my sincere apologies."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I am not one of your kind," she snarled. "No matter how you mean it, I am not."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>...Scary.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I'd have to be careful about getting her mad in the future.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The future? The only future I'm interested in is one without computer nerd succubuses (or any other kind). Even if I am the Jude Law of succubuses, it's just too much, facing this kind of danger.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Children, please stand down," said Austen.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Then he disappeared into the darkness.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>And Bigfoot struck.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>He moved so fast that Sophia didn't even have time to blink; just as I had been unable to avoid the attack from Amber's little Capuchin, Sasquatch's huge, meaty fist swung in too fast to dodge and pulverized her pretty face into a mess of blood, meat, and bone.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>What a waste of a good-looking sort of girl.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>So I thought, but when the spray cleared, although her face was covered with blood, it didn't seem to be any worse for wear.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Someone's been feeding you well," Sophia commented. "You're stronger than most I've seen."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The tail swung up, but this time she wasn't caught off guard. She grabbed the stinger in her left hand, and an instant later, it had detached from the rest of the tail.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Claws—no, talons, like those of a bird of prey, like those the eagles must have used to carry Bilbo up to their eyries—had sprung from her fingers.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Those creepy gold eyes flared up, and as Sasquatch recoiled, in shock from losing his stinger, that cute, intelligent, slightly ditzy computer nerd succubus jumped at him in her underwear and sank all five talons on her right hand into his chest.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Those talons were unreasonably huge. They looked sharp, too.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Picture Edward Scissor-Hands.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>They really made a mess of Sasquatch's chest, carving out a cavity around his heart like he was a Thanksgiving turkey.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Then the left hand, equally as full of huge, sharp talons, each like the gladius of a Roman legionnaire, swung around and swept through Sasquatch's head, leaving it scattered around the room in five bloody slices.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>And she looked around the room at the other figures, still half-visible in the darkness, and roared, like a mountain lion, as if to say "Who else wants some?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>...Scary.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The other Abominable Snowmen evidently agreed, because they sank back into the darkness.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Let's go." She reached a hand out to me as she passed, and I recoiled, expecting to be skewered by talons, but they were gone.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>That's a neat trick. Sort of like Wolverine retracting his claws.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Just to make her feel better, I took her hand and let her lead the way up to the regular basement of the church, and up the drafty staircase back to the worship room. I repeat, it was just to make her feel like she was doing a good job of rescuing me. It definitely wasn't because I was terrified, or on the edge of an anxiety attack after nearly being eaten by those things in there, or struggling to walk because my legs wanted to collapse under me, and there certainly wasn't a small part of me that enjoyed touching the skin of a sexy girl in her underwear, even if it was just the skin of her hand and the underwear had strawberries. Those motives did not come into play at all; it was purely charity from me to her. It was the least I could do for her, with this being the second time she'd rescued me in as many days.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>At this point, I should probably mention something that didn't seem important at the time, but in retrospect, may have been rather significant. To hear about this, we must cast our minds back to last night, before the succubus and I had parted ways at the corner of Holly and Vine. We were walking and talking under the orange sky.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I was curious as to how a succubus lives.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I lead a very boring life," was her reply. "I do homework. I like to watch <span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1">Jeopardy </span>in the evenings. I read whatever's on the bestseller's shelf at the library. I feed my cat. I take walks often, and jog every morning. I sometimes go hiking in the hills. I usually cook my own food."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"French cooking?" I asked.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"If by 'French cooking' you mean that the person who cooked it is French. Most of what I make is pretty simple."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"And you eat regular food?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I can't die of hunger or thirst as long as I've fed, but I still feel pain from them. And I still enjoy eating."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Do you at least get fussy about wine?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I don't drink it."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Cognac?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I don't drink it."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Cheese?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I get fussy if it's too runny or smells bad."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Bread?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I buy it from Safeway's bakery."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Chocolate?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups and Hershey's Symphony bars with Nilla Wafers."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Fashion?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Look at how I'm dressed."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Jerry Lewis?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Never heard of him."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Foie gras?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I feel sorry for those ducks they use to make it."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Truffles?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I'd rather not eat something that had a pig's nose all over it."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Filet mignon?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"It's good, but overpriced."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Tintin?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I could talk for hours about it!"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Finally, some evidence that this girl was French.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"By the way, that might be why I had a good feeling about you from early on," she added. "You're sort of like Tintin."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I've never been so flattered," I said. "But couldn't you have said John Constantine? He's the one I modeled my life after. I'm aiming to get lung cancer and be resurrected before too long."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She giggled.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>No, I'm not joking.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She actually giggled.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Well, I've got to go this way," she said, pointing down the street.</span><p class="standard"><span>"Oh, okay."</span></p></p><p class="standard"><span>"Good night."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Good—"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The reason I did not finish saying good night was that she suddenly seized the back of my head, leaned in, and kissed me. With tongue.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>In a porn movie, this would have segued into the two of us having sex in a back alley that looks suspiciously like someone's garage with some garbage cans in it. In the worst case, it might have a bare mattress on the floor too. I was terrified that she planned to make that same segue in real life, even if we could find a convenient bare mattress in one of these alleys.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>If she did, it would end with me as a dried-out husk.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>But after about 3.5 seconds, she pulled her tongue out, released me, and ran off at a rather impressive speed in the direction she had pointed.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I mention this now because she had twice said things like "I impressed my scent on you" and "I marked this male", and unless she can do such things just by thinking about it without any physical contact, that must have been the reason why she suddenly stuck her tongue down my throat last night.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Either that or my lips just looked so kissable in the light of the setting sun that she couldn't resist.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I was going from the Jude Law of succubuses to the Angelina Jolie of succubuses.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>In any case, knowing that this happened is relevant to what I said next, which was, "Did you put some weird succubus scent mark on me when you stole my first kiss the other night?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Yes."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Don't do that! I don't want some weird succubusy-smelling oils that will never wash off on me!"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"It's too late."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"So now everyone's going to think I'm your chalupa?!"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Something like that." She nodded, affirming with both words and actions that she was a terrible person, a rapist who forced innocent young men to become her sex slaves by stealing their first kisses and leaving weird smells all over them.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Let go of my hand!" I tried to pull it free.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I won't, and you can't get free from me!"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She was right.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Her grip strength was unbelievable.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>There was a surprise waiting for us in the main room of the church, sort of like the surprise you experience on Christmas morning, except this was actually a child-molesting incubus with a gun.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>He had a gun.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>He had no pride as an infernal being. What kind of demonic being uses a gun?</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Don't mention <span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1">Devil May Cry</span>—when I failed to beat the last boss for the eighty-ninth time, I erased its existence from my world.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Miss," said Austen. "You'll pardon me for not trusting you, since we've only just met, but I do need that boy to die. Would you mind taking him right here, so I can be sure that he's dead?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Do you really want to see her bang me that badly?" I asked.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Austen ignored me, that gun—it was a revolver, probably a .45, but that was as far as my knowledge of guns went—trained on me, while his eyes focused on Sophia. I wondered if he was passing her some kind of succubus telepathy saying <span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1">"Please, please, please!"</span>After all, he had just tried to kill her too, and now he had the gall to ask if he could watch her have sex with me?</span></p><p class="standard"><span>If he was begging in triplicate via telepathy, Sophia was totally ignoring him, because she was tensed up, her teeth were bared, and her fingers were curled into claws, looking ready to spring blades any second now. "I would mind," she said.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Then I reckon I'll have to shoot him," said Austen, and he pulled the trigger.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She was in front of me when it hit.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Austen's aim was total crap; the bullet would have hit the floor before it got to me, but Sophia was closer to him than I was, and the burning chunk of metal tore through her left hip, cutting a path through blood, flesh, and bone.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Then the talons reappeared.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Hey, hey, those look even bigger than before. They're almost as long as your whole body.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She flicked her right wrist upward.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Next thing I knew, Austen's left hand had detached from his arm, along with the revolver it held.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It took him a second, but he started moaning and clutching at the wound in a rather pathetic manner, trying to wrap the stump in his shirt to stem the blood loss. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>I wanted to laugh at him, but since I almost wet myself when I was surrounded by those Abominable Snowmen of his, I felt that I could not do so in good conscience.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Sophia, meanwhile, commenced ignoring Austen almost as soon as his hand had parted from his wrist. "I left my clothes on one of these pews, but I don't remember which," she said. "Ah, here we go. Would you mind turning around while I get dressed?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I did so, too distracted by the screaming and moaning and flowing blood to ask why she needed me to turn around when she was already in her underwear.</span></p><p class="standard"><span></span></p><p class="standard"><span></span></p><p class="standard"><span></span></p>

You did, didn't you?" even though she'd already been in her strawberry-print bra and panties, in full view of my lecherous eyes, before she made me turn around.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>All this while the local pastor screamed and cradled his bloody stump of a left hand ten feet away.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>By the way, while I'd been turned around, her hair had gone back to being mousy brown and her eyes had become a lot less gold-colored and a lot more the color of stuff that grows on bread when you forget about it in the cupboard for too long.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>We then left the church.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I felt like singing.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I felt like jumping in the air and clicking my heels together.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I was alive, and whole, and not dead, and not torn apart and distributed to the stomachs of fanged, grinning monkey creatures with scorpion stingers.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>But as happy as I was to be alive, this was the second time that Austen had tried to do bodily harm to me (third if you counted the attempt to shoot me in the lobby as a separate incident). He would surely try again.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"<span class="T2">I can sense when you're in danger," Sophia told me when she opened this topic for discussion. "It's one reason I marked you. But it takes time for me to reach you. I had to fly to get here in time, in only partial darkness, and I still barely made it."</span></span></p><p class="standard"><span>You did cut it pretty—wait, you can fly?</span><p class="standard"><span>"Did you think my wings were just to look cool?"</span></p></p><p class="standard"><span>I was about to make a clever response, but my stomach suddenly seized up again and I stumbled.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Careful. Are you still a little unsteady on your feet?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I'm fine. Just...something to drink would be nice."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>We went into the nearest convenience store and bought overpriced convenience store drinks, then sat down on a nearby bench to drink them.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I'm going to publish," I said. "I'll write up Amber's and Mrs. Sullivan's stories tonight and make sure it's posted by tomorrow."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>With every fiber of my being, I wanted to ruin him. I wanted to ruin the life of the man who had three times tried to take mine (twice if you counted what just happened as a single incident). </span></p><p class="standard"><span>"That may only make him angry, and lead him to try to get revenge," said Sophia. "And even if he is taken into police custody, it will be at least a few days before it happens. What will you do until then?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I shrugged. "Now that I know he's after me, maybe I'll be able to spot the next trap and avoid it next time."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I know!"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She said, as if she'd just had the best idea in the world.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Riding the bus is too dangerous. From now on, I'll pick you up and drop you off."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I don't think it's a good idea for you to strip down to your underwear and fly into my neighborhood...the people there are pretty conservative. Even the gay couple three houses down voted for Proposition 8."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I have a car."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>There was a pregnant pause.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"You do?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She took a sip of her iced tea. "How do you think I've been getting to and from school?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Flying?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Everyone would see me in my underwear."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"If you have a car, why did you walk with me the other night like you were also going on foot?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I just wanted to talk you. I doubled back and got it after I escaped from those gangsters."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"So, let me make sure I'm hearing this properly. In order to protect me, you are going to drive your car to my house, pick me up, drive both of us to school, drive me back to my house, drop me off, and drive yourself home?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"You could abstract it a bit more, but yes, that's more or less what I was proposing."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>No looking for a bus stop in the nightlife area.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>No being wedged between a sweaty fat man and an old woman who smells like cigarettes.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>A bodyguard everywhere I went.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I think she might have just had the best idea in the world.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The last time either of my parents drove me anywhere was in the eighth grade, when I went to school late because of a doctor appointment. After that, I had been made to walk, take a bicycle, or ride the bus to get absolutely everywhere.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It may have had something to do with my comment that my mother drove "like a racecar driver with Parkinson's".</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I even apologized, but she wouldn't budge, and she snapped at my father if he tried to drive me anywhere.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>As a present for my sixteenth birthday, she let me borrow the car long enough to take the driving exam three times. I failed the first two times. The third time I ran a yellow light and bribed the examiner to ignore it. I had a car at one point, an old Ford Taurus whose oil needed to be refilled every thirty miles, but it eventually died and I decided it was easier to take the bus. Now that I didn't have a job and spent five hundred dollars a semester on textbooks, I couldn't afford to get another car, so I was stuck with the bus.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>That may help explain why I was so thrilled with this plan to keep me safe from Austen.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Succubus chauffeuring.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I eagerly agreed to her plan to keep me safe, and after finishing our drinks, we rode the bus back to the college, where she brought me to her car to take me home.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Her tastes seemed to lean towards the plain, so I was expecting something generic, but she actually had a pretty nice navy blue Audi with big, comfortable leather upholstered seats, a GPS unit on the dashboard, and a fancy stereo system. When she turned the key, opera music blared from the speakers, but she quickly turned it off and said in an embarrassed tone that it was part of an assignment for music appreciation.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>By the way, unlike my mother, Sophia's driving was quite smooth and easy. She steered around potholes gracefully and halted at traffic lights in a stately manner, like a cruise ship coming into port. We arrived at my house without incident.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She hadn't turned on that GPS at all, yet here we were.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>By this point I knew better than to ask how she knew where my house was.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Shall I walk you up to the door?" she asked once she had parked along the curb.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I'll be fine. You don't have to treat me like I'm your date to the prom."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"But I'm protecting you. How should I treat you?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Be more like the Secret Service. Come up with a secret codename for me, and report all my actions using it, repeating each sentence three times."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"You mean I should call you 'Trojan' and say things like 'Trojan has brought in the horse, I repeat, Trojan has brought in the horse'?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"At least call me 'Spartan', damn it."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She reached out towards me all of a sudden, and I pulled back, thinking she was going to grab me and steal my second kiss, but fortunately, since I was in a car and there wasn't anywhere to pull back to, she just petted me on the head.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Good boy."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Don't treat me like a dog either."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Dogs are honest about their feelings, but you're acting weird to try and hide your embarrassment because you're grateful to me for helping you, so I was treating you like a cat."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"That's not any better. And I wasn't doing anything like that. Get your hand off my head."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>But not quite yet, that feels nice.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Once her hand was off my head, I said, "Of course I'm grateful for your help. I'm not into dying painfully. It's not my thing. Even dying painlessly is just meh. But it's weird."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"What is?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Why are you protecting me?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I asked.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I was trying to learn from my experience with Amber.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Why, you ask...That's sort of a hard question to answer. I guess the best response is, because I want to."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"That's not really an answer."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Then, how about saying it's a secret."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"That's even more of a non-answer."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Does it really matter?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"It matters if your reason is to protect your food supply, like you told Austen."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She shook her head. "The reason we have the scent-marking ability is to warn other succubi to stay away from our prey. That's also why I can sense when you're in danger—in case I need to defend you from other succubi. That's the reason Austen would have expected. I also hoped he might give up if he thought you were doomed anyway. But that's not why I marked you."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Why, then?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Because you interest me. I don't know what, but something about you fascinated me from the moment I saw you. As I told you, I lead a very boring life. When something as interesting as you turns up, I can't just ignore it."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Now that was an answer I trusted.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Self-interest was always easier to believe in than altruism.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>And with that, I bade good night to that Audi-driving computer nerd succubus and returned to my house.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>My sister Sue was in the kitchen, drinking milk from the carton in her pajamas.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It felt like it had been days since I'd seen her, but even at the best of times the two of us don't really talk. We just don't seem to mix well, and mostly ignore each other.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Tonight, though, she greeted me and asked me a question. "Who was that in the car? I thought you rode the bus to school."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Oh, that was the computer nerd s—student."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>That was close. I almost used the <span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1">s</span>-word.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"You're hanging out with computer nerds now? Jeez, and I thought you couldn't stoop any lower."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Take back that slander against all the people who make sure the servers work so you can update your Facebook page every three minutes. And against the people who invented Facebook in the first place. And the entire Internet, for that matter, and the computer you access it from. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I'm not really hanging out with her...we just happened to be going the same way, and it was late."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Oh, I see. So it's a <span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1">girl </span>computer nerd." Sue had the most annoying smirk. She smirked that smirk when she was thinking about relationships, mostly, and mostly she thought about relationships, so she spent a lot of time smirking that smirk. Smirking that smirk with a milk mustache in her pajamas. Seeing that made me think how absolutely different she was from Lucy, even though they were sisters separated by a mere two years. "I'm surprised, I always thought you were gay."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Normally, I would respond to something like that, but talking to Sue had made me remember why I usually didn't talk to her, so I didn't rise to her bait and just told her it was disgusting to drink milk straight out of the carton before going to my room to work on the article.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I had made a big deal out of it when I was talking to Sophia, as if writing this article would be a death struggle against sleepiness to get it all done in one night, but actually, it only took about a thousand words to relate both Amber's and Mrs. Sullivan's stories in all the detail I had, and I could type about seventy words a minute, so it only took me about half an hour to finish.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>In junior high school, I had spent a year writing a truly awful novel that was mostly stolen from Thomas Pynchon's <span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1">The Crying of Lot 49</span>, with elements of <span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1">Pale Fire</span>, <span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1">Catch-22</span>,<span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1"></span>and <span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1">Conan the Barbarian</span>. I had written about fifty thousand words before I ran out of steam, went back for the first time to read what I had written so far, and realized that it was the worst thing ever written, even if you counted the works of Hiro Mashima as literature. It was a good experience. Well, it was a terrible experience, one which forced me to admit that I was more worthless than the most worthless writer I had ever complained about, but I did learn to type seventy words a minute, so I got something out of it besides the dissolution of all my dreams.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Thanks to that, I was done with the article I hoped would ruin Austen in about thirty minutes, and I spent the next hour or so working on my analysis of the yaoi subtext in <span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1">The Importance of Being Earnest </span>before going to sleep.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The next morning, I decided to make breakfast before calling Lucy, so that I could devote my full concentration to explaining why Algernon wanted to Bunbury himself all in Jack, and the hints that Jack was a sasoi-uke, but unexpectedly, the phone rang before I was finished and it turned out to be Lucy calling me for once.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I saw your article this morning," she said.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"What did you think?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Garbage."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>No hesitation at all.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Which parts, Madam Lucy, if I may be so rewarded as to be permitted to humbly ask?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I'm so glad you did. For one thing, you were far too detailed in describing the sex acts that Amber girl was forced to perform. That part read more like a porn novel than a news story."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I just wrote down what she told me."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Also, you switched the names of Mrs. Sullivan and Amber's mother."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Actually, I did that on purpose. Didn't you see the asterisk next to it?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"But this was the worst part, here at the end—"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Did you print it and make notes on it?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Of course. There were far more things wrong with this article than I could tell you over the phone, so I'm sending you this copy by first-class mail. The biggest problem was here at the end, when you go on a mini-tirade against Austen. 'We must expunge this viper from our nest'? 'What he did to these children can never be undone'? Those are hoary old cliches and completely destroy any pretension of journalistic objectivity you may have had. I never expected either of those things from you—you've reported on criminals in the past, but never in the form of pseudo-moralistic rants. What were you trying to do?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I was trying to tell people the truth," I said, knowing that it was a lie.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Really? Because it seems—correct me if I'm wrong—it <span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1">seems </span>like you got angry at Austen, probably over that Amber girl, and set out to destroy his image in town. It <span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1">seems </span>like you abandoned those journalistic ethics you used to brag about to sensationalize this story and do harm to Austen's reputation. Am I wrong?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She wasn't.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I wanted to ruin him.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Because he had tried to kill me.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I had nearly been killed while researching stories in the past, but it had always been because I had gone into some dangerous place, done some dangerous thing, actively risked myself. No one had ever tried to attack me on my way home. No one had ever tried to feed me to demonic creatures.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I was afraid.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I couldn't protect myself.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I had to trust in that computer nerd succubus to protect me.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>That's why I wanted to ruin Austen, to destroy his disguise, to take away his ability to operate as part of the human world.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>A human can solve a human problem.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>A succubus can solve a succubus problem.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>But who can solve a problem that can change shape, into a human problem to avoid resolution by succubuses, into a succubus problem to avoid resolution by humans?</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I wanted to ruin him, because I was afraid. Because I wanted to take away his ability to shape shift into a human problem.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Of course, I couldn't tell Lucy any of that.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>In fact, I did consider telling her about JZ's gang, but no matter how she acted, Lucy actually loved me quite a bit, and she could be hot-headed. I didn't want her showing up at the airport tomorrow ready to jujitsu JZ. That would be bad for her and for me.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>As I was pondering how to answer and the silence lengthened, a navy blue Audi suddenly appeared in our driveway. "Oh, I've got to go. My ride's here."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Your ride? Someone's driving you to school?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Yeah."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Who?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"A classmate."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"A friend?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She said it, not me.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Don't be ridiculous," I said. "I'm just using her for her car. We sit in silence the whole time and stare out the windows, just like on the bus."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Oh, it's a female classmate?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Maybe Lucy and Sue weren't that different after all.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Although I was sure that Lucy was sitting in New York with perfect posture, sipping a cup of fine tea while wearing her Something or Other Academy of the Arts skirt and blazer, rather than drinking milk from the carton in her pajamas.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Well, I'll let you go for now, but this isn't over," said Lucy. "If I see any more garbage like this, you will suffer my extreme displeasure."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Yeah, yeah."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I won't talk to you on the phone for a week."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Are you a devil?!"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"By the way, try to treat your female classmate who's driving you to school but isn't a friend well. If she's driving you to school, she must not hate you, so don't you think it would be nice if you could get to know her better?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I'd rather have you drive me to school."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"If you were aiming for creepiness, you missed the mark. Let's try a little harder next time."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I'd like to try you a little harder next time."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"That just sounded like a sex-starved, brain-damaged truck driver. It lacked that skin-crawling element that characterizes your usual remarks. Anyway, you'd better not make your not friend wait any longer. I'm hanging up."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>After Lucy hung up, I gathered my things and went outside. Sophia had gotten out of the car and was standing next to it in the driveway. For some reason, it seemed she had put a little more effort into her appearance this morning; her hair actually looked brushed and she had worn a nice jean jacket and sunglasses with her usual jeans and blouse combo.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"You're unusually well groomed today," I commented.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I thought your family might be here."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"So you don't mind if everyone at school thinks you're a slob who doesn't know how to use a hairbrush, but you mind if my family thinks so?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Well, I might be knowing them for a while. First impressions are important in a case like that."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>So she was planning to know my family for a while.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>There was a terrible sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Also, she was making a complete mockery of all that stuff they say about making lifelong friends in college by implying that she wasn't going to know anyone at the college for as long as a while. But I guess it would be pretty hard to show up at a reunion and tell people that you've currently faked your own death and enrolled in another college to get another degree as a different person, while sucking the life force from whatever men you can find in the local bars who fit your definition of evil enough.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Fortunately, my family was all gone by the time I needed to leave, so she wasn't going to be meeting them anytime soon.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>For the next few days, that computer nerd succubus came to pick me up wearing a different simple yet stylish outfit in her navy blue Audi that silently whispered money rather than screaming it.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I wanted to kill her.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>All this time she was pretending to be a loser, and yet she was the closest thing to a bourgeoisie I had ever known. No wonder those French revolutionaries tried to kill her.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Meanwhile, I was biding my time, waiting for someone to pick up my posting and crucify Austen in the press.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I respected Lucy's opinion more than anyone's, especially when it came to writing, but she didn't always understand how news writing worked. Her expertise was all in literary writing. All the defects she had mentioned were things that I genuinely agreed would have been defects in a literary-style work, or even in a news article aimed at educated, upper-middle class readers of papers like the New York <span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1">Times.</span></span></p><p class="standard"><span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1"></span>But that wasn't my audience. My audience was the inhabitants of a cluster of small towns in the Sierra Nevada foothills. Most of them didn't have a college degree; most of them were religious to some extent; most of them had strong ideas about crime, punishment, and morality; most of them were uncomfortable with talking about sex.</p><p class="standard"><span>That's why I had tried to first make them uncomfortable by talking about sex, and then tried to appeal to their religious ideas about morality.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I hoped they would turn against even their beloved pastor, if his wrongdoings were presented in the correct light.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I was wrong.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The Santa Robles <span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1">Times-Chronicle </span>picked up my story three days after I had posted it. I'd been keeping an eye on all the local papers and watching the news every night so I would know immediately.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Unlike the bigger papers, the locals almost never tried to buy a story; they would just have somebody paraphrase everything and publish it as an original work. Nonetheless, the paraphraser this time had kept most of the original tone of my blog posting as he decried the shocking immorality of beloved pastor Joseph Austen.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It was also on the nightly news.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Now was the time to find out if my betrayal had borne fruit.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>They talked to Austen.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>He denied it.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>They talked to Amber Linney.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She denied it, saying that Pastor Austen had always been like a father to her.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>They talked to Jane Linney.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She denied it, saying that Pastor Austen had always been like a father to Amber.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>They talked to Mrs. Sullivan.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She denied it.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The newscaster finished by saying that police believed the story had been the work of an online prankster, and it seemed likely the controversy would blow over in a few days.</span></p>

      <div id="chaptertext">
        <p class="standard"><span>So now I know what insane people feel like.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>For all I know, I am insane. After all, I've met a succubus, an incubus, a girl who gave birth to a demon child, said demon child, and some of what demon children grow up to be in just the last few days.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>But I hadn't felt insane until this moment.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It was knowing, <span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1">knowing</span><span class="T2">, having seen with my own eyes, that something had happened, and having no one at all believe it. Having no way to prove it. Being unable to tell anyone the full story. It made me feel crazy.</span></span></p><p class="standard"><span>I had felt pressured to publish, pressured to ruin Austen, to weaken his ability to strike at me, and I had published without having a single victim or witness willing to testify against him. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>I had expected Amber would deny it.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I had expected Amber's mother wouldn't know a thing about it.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>That's why I had gone so far as to betray Mrs. Sullivan by publishing her full name, as I had told her I wouldn't do, hoping that once the real reporters were knocking on her door, she'd find herself willing to talk. Granted, her story wasn't exactly a shocking indictment of Austen—she hadn't even connected her son's condition to the pastor until I asked her for some connection between all the victims—but it would have at least made it harder to dismiss the allegations as the work of some online prankster.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Then I had tricked Lucy by sending her a text message saying my story was done and up, knowing she would look at it the next morning and that very few others would. In that version, I had mentioned only the first names 'June' and 'Jane', and I had switched them, describing 'Jane' as the mother of the elementary school boy and 'June' as the mother of the teenage girl.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>As soon as Sophia dropped me off after school that day, I had raced up to my room and edited the posting, switching 'June' and 'Jane' back to their proper owners, and adding last names to boot.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Lucy would find out eventually, but I had only needed to trick her until the story was picked up by someone else. Once she found out, she would be angry. She would be disappointed. She might even refuse to answer my calls for a week. As hard as it would be, I could live with that.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I couldn't refuse a direct order from her.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>If she had found out before I published and had ordered me not to release Mrs. Sullivan's name, I would have had to obey. That's the sort of relationship we have.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>And if she had given me a direct order, and I had obeyed it and not published Mrs. Sullivan's name, I would have lost my only chance to ruin Austen quickly.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Now it was lost anyway. Mrs. Sullivan had refused to talk.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Maybe someone from the network would harass her and get her to talk eventually, or maybe someone else would make a complaint against Austen and get things rolling, but until then, it looked like I was going to be riding the succubus taxi to school every day. Austen may have decided to let me go after I failed to ruin him, but he might think I still knew something, or he might just be the vindictive type.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Something I just said rang a bell.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>'Maybe someone else would make a complaint against Austen'.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Someone else had made a complaint.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>They had just been ignored.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I broached the subject with Sophia the next day in the car.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"The Robsons," I said.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Is that some classic cartoon? I thought I was familiar with them all."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"No, you idiot, they're the couple that Amber brought the money to. Their son was in the hospital getting a C-section to remove the demon child."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"You can't sit in heavy, thoughtful silence, refusing all attempts at conversation, for over thirty minutes and then suddenly say 'the Robsons' and expect me to know what you're talking about," she fairly countered.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I hated her for the fairness of her countering.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I mean, I published my story. I outed Mrs. Sullivan, hoping she would testify against Austen, but she didn't, so I thought I was pretty much screwed," I said.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Oh, this isn't so bad. You get to ride to school in a car every day. You were thrilled the first few days. I half-expected you to stick your head out the window and let your tongue wag."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"But I forgot the Robsons," I continued, ignoring her attempt to treat me like a dog again. "They knew Austen had something to do with their son's condition. They tried to press charges. Even if they took his money in the end, they might still be willing to talk. Even if it's a weak testimony, it'll be enough to show that the whole thing wasn't made up by some jackass with too much time on his hands, and in an area like this, even a weak testimony could go a long way."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"That's pretty impressive. As expected of you, you come up with the ideas that no one else has," Sophia said guilelessly.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Stop praising me like I'm a precocious three-year-old."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"But you make me want to praise you as if you're a precocious three-year-old."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Another thought occurred to me. "By the way, where are you in all this?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"What do you mean?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"You're a succubus. Austen is an incubus. You could solve this problem right away, unless Austen's too strong for you."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"No, I think he's quite weak. He even used a gun, did you notice?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Yeah, and he couldn't even do that right."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I think he doesn't have many powers beyond making demon children. If I needed to fight him, I could win, most likely. But as much as I regret it, I have to work under certain restrictions. One of them is that I don't do conspicuous things like killing the well-known pastor of a small town."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"You cut his hand off!"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Yes, to protect you, because he couldn't do much other than go to the hospital to get it reattached and tell them that he had an accident with his table saw. If he dies, people will notice."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"If it's okay to cut his hand off to protect me, then just think of this as preemptively protecting me."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"It's not so simple. In actuality, I probably shouldn't be protecting you. I'm sorry, James, but all I can do is protect you from direct attacks. I can't do anything else for you unless I have evidence that Austen is planning to do something that could reveal his identity as a supernatural creature on a large scale."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Tch, you're useless."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"You're going to make me cry."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I was about to snap at her not to joke around when it was my life she was refusing to preemptively protect, but she honestly did look a little sad, so I held back my anger and dropped the subject.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Guess I'll have to settle for a human solution.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>As usual, I had not brought my cell phone, so when we arrived at the college, I asked Sophia if I could borrow hers. She handed it over without complaint. When I saw it was the newest model iPhone, I raised my hand to smash it against the dashboard, but she might kill me if I smashed her phone in a jealous rage, so I resisted my anger that this frumpy-looking computer nerd succubus had been hiding the newest iPhone in addition to her Audi and stylish wardrobe and dialed the Santa Robles social services office. I asked the receptionist who answered to connect me with someone I knew in the office. </span><span>His name was Daniel Franklin. We'd met while I was reporting on a local crack whore's children being taken away for the eighteenth time.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>When he found out I was a college student, the first thing he'd told me was that I shouldn't even consider majoring in humanities, creative writing, or any sort of literature. That's how you end up like him, he told me.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The second thing he'd told me was "I ask of you, are you my Master?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>He loved Saber-chan.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>He loved her more than his job or common decency.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Thus, we had forged a bond.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Hello, you've reached Daniel Franklin," he said when I got through.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Daniel, it's James Moran," I said.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Oh, James. I saw your story about Joseph Austen the other night. Dude, what were you thinking? You should've like, taken a chill pill before writing that, man."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>As soon as he knew it was me, his style of speech changed into that of a teenager from an '80s movie.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It was pretty annoying, but I guess he was trying to make me feel comfortable around him in his own way. Either that, or he was just a fat man-child who existed only to buy overpriced import goods. But I needed him, so I tolerated his annoying points.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I need some information relating to that," I told him.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Give it up, man. Austen's invincible."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Then I'm dead." I told him, as quickly as I could, about the incident with JZ and his gang.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Dude, that's like, a total bummer. Maybe you could, like, get the cops to round up those guys, and one of them would sell out Austen for a plea deal?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"In the meantime, Austen will just hire someone else to finish me, and maybe whoever ratted on him too."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"All right, all right. What d'you need, man?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I want to know if you have any information on the Robson family. I don't know the parents' names, but they had a child named Richard."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"All right...lemme see here..."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I'll spare you any more of his 'dude' and 'man' and just get straight to the point.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>There was a Robson family with a child called Richard in the computer. A short time ago, Child Protective Services had taken Richard away, claiming that his parents were abusing him. The parents had been put on trial for said abuse and had lost. The father had been sent to county jail for a year. The mother, on the other hand, had made a statement, against the advisement of her lawyer, claiming that Austen had raped and somehow impregnated their son. When the doctors and nurses who had supposedly performed her son's C-section were nowhere to be found, she too had gone to jail for a while, but she'd been moved to a mental hospital. Daniel gave me their names and the name and address of the mental hospital, then hung up with a "Chill dude. I'm sure Caliburn will manifest in time to defeat this Berserker."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It's really horrible when he hangs up like that.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I almost felt physical discomfort at the awfulness of that line.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Once I had hung up on him, I turned to Sophia and demanded that she drive to the jailhouse so I could speak with Arthur Robson.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Class begins in fifteen minutes. I'll take you afterward."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"This is more important than hearing what new idiocy Latrom is going to come up with or exploring exciting new vistas of boredom with Pandit! It affects you too—if I can ruin Austen, you won't have to drive me to school anymore."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I don't mind driving you to school."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Besides, this is the fifth time you've taken these classes! Aren't you even a little sick of them by now?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Fine, fine. By the way, may I have my phone back?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I reluctantly gave it back to her.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>For being a jail, the jailhouse was surprisingly nice. It was newer than some of the buildings at the school; the floors were clean, and none of the tiles were falling off the walls, and it didn't have that same ambiance of decay and decline that most of the college's buildings had, and there wasn't mold growing underneath decades of dirt behind the sideboards. All in all, it seemed like a decent enough place to pay a debt to society.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>However, when I asked the clerk if I could visit Arthur Robson, the clerk replied,</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Guess you hadn't heard. Robson got shanked a few days ago. He died last night."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>and shattered my hopes of resolving this quickly.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Austen must be behind this.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>He was tying up all the loose ends, making sure I (or someone like me) couldn't bring him to the brink of ruin again.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I next had Sophia drive me to the mental hospital.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It was outside of town, which was why I had gone to the jail first.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She had known more or less how to get to the jail, but for this she had to turn on her fancy GPS. </span><span>When it said "Turn left at the light ahead" in its pleasing female voice and we arrived without once stopping to yell for directions at a pedestrian or fumbling in the glove compartment for a map that would never be folded up correctly again, I wanted to smash it against the dashboard.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>After getting in by telling an uppity, suspicious orderly that I was Wenjing Robson's distant cousin by marriage, I was escorted to a large, open room and told to wait for someone to bring Mrs. Robson out. After a moment they brought out a tall Chinese woman. I could see the traces of a self-assured gait, a straight-backed posture, the sharp gaze of a career woman, but they were only traces; for the most part, she was hunched, shuffling, and a bit hazy in the eyes.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Hello, Mrs. Robson, my name is James Moran," I told her. "I write a blog about local news."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"You're here about Pastor Austen, aren't you."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Even in her medicated haze, it seemed she was pretty sharp.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Yes. I published a story a few days ago, but none of the people I spoke to were willing to repeat their stories to the real reporters, so I ended up getting written off as a crackpot."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I don't know what good I can do you. They told me I'm a paranoid schizophrenic. That means I'm paranoid and crazy. They won't listen to the testimony of a paranoid, crazy person."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I know the story about your son being pregnant was true."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>That stopped her for a second. "How do you...?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I've seen evidence. But you'd think I was the one who belonged in here if I told you. Please just tell me everything you know about Austen. To the recorder, if you don't mind." I took out my small digital recorder and showed it to her.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She shrugged. "I guess if there's even a small chance..."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Almost a year ago, Mrs. Robson told me, her son had started acting strange. Like the Sullivan boy, he'd become depressed and started acting out. They took him to a counselor, but it didn't help. Then, after a few months, his stomach became distended. His parents rushed him to the hospital, and the doctors ran various tests on him.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>An ultrasound found something growing inside him. Something that looked remarkably like a baby.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>When Richie heard this, he started to cry. He told his parents that Austen had touched him the way you touch someone to make a baby with them. The Robsons raised a fuss at the school, but Austen managed to talk his way out of it somehow. They had tried to find other victims among the parents of children in Austen's after-school program, but had no luck. They had finally hired a private investigator to look into Austen.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The private investigator discovered that over the years, Austen had molested over thirty children in his after-school program. The first victims were now in their twenties; most of them had never told anyone. Any who had spoken up had disappeared somehow, usually moving away, but sometimes dying mysteriously along with their parents in car accidents or freak meat grinder incidents. Several victims had been pregnant; one, Amber Linney, had been pregnant almost ten times.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>At this I had stopped her. "Wait. Amber told me her first pregnancy took about three months, and that it happened when she was thirteen. There wasn't enough time for her to be pregnant ten times."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"No, thirteen sounds correct for ten of them," said Mrs. Robson.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"But at three months each, that only leaves enough time for four in a year."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"And twelve in three years."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>So that was a lie.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Well, all women lie about their ages.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>In addition to impregnating the children in his program, Austen had spent his nights and weekends going around and impregnating any woman he could find in the bars in nearby towns, as well as hiring prostitutes with church funds so he could get them pregnant too. The investigator even discovered that Austen had had a huge crate of some kind of date rape drug delivered to his house, probably so he could impregnate people even against their will.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The Robsons were prepared to bring all the evidence they had to the police. Just before doing so, they refused the money that Amber brought to their son's hospital room.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Then came the abuse trial.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The rest, I had heard.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I honestly didn't think I could use this.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>By the way, before I left, Mrs. Robson asked me if I knew anything about how her son was doing. Daniel had told me he was with a foster family and had been having trouble adjusting, but I doubted she wanted to hear that, so this:</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"He's fine, but I'm sure he misses his mother."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>is what I said, and she cried a little. I think she would have cried no matter what I said, so worrying about it was meaningless.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Did you find anything out?" Sophia asked when I returned to the car.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Not a damn thing."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>On the way back to the school, I played Mrs. Robson's story for her.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Is this enough for your rules? He's killing people, ruining lives, breaking up families, and probably also jaywalking—isn't that enough for your rules?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I'm sorry...I'm really, truly sorry for that woman and what's happened to her...but all of that is still a human problem."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"He's using his incubus powers on people."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"But he's not doing it conspicuously, and that's the key. The rules weren't designed to protect humans from supernatural creatures. It's actually the opposite—they were made to protect supernatural creatures from humans."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I couldn't believe it.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"You people are all messed up and backwards, then, because when I see one person who can grow blades out of her fingers and regenerate from a bullet wound in milliseconds, not to mention suck the life force out of men with sex, and the other person can die from stepping on a rusty nail if he happens to have an out of date tetanus vaccine, I can't help thinking it's the second guy who needs to be protected. It's like sticking George Foreman in the ring with Rick Moranis—by your logic, Moranis needs to be handicapped."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Sophia shook her head.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Of course that's true in a hand-to-hand fight, or when we have the advantage of being hidden, but on a societal level, it isn't. Think of a village menaced by wild man-eating tigers. Of course, if a tiger takes a human by surprise in the bush, the human can't hope to fight off the tiger. But if the village bands together and takes rifles out into the jungle to hunt down the tigers, the tigers can't win, because they're outnumbered and disorganized."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"It's the same for supernatural creatures. We once lived more openly. A band of seven vampires could defeat an entire army of mounted knights and foot soldiers, so we had nothing to fear. And even if a few people discovered us, evidence of our existence couldn't be circulated on a large scale, so governments and institutions would never organize against us. But the printing press ended that. We couldn't be so open anymore, because the villagers had finally connected the dots on all those disappearances and figured out that tigers had done it, and they put together hunting parties. The fact of our existence and the methods for killing us could be easily spread. Weapons technology advanced as well—a vampire's claws are just as useless as a tiger's against a gun. And we've never been organized as a single society. There are too many species, with competing needs and worldviews. Secrecy was our only hope to survive. We couldn't allow vampires to take over entire villages, or attack royalty, or hold hedonistic parties where nobles paid to be turned anymore, because those things would alert the humans to our existence, and the rampant witch burnings in Europe made it pretty clear what would come of that. That's why we made the rules, and that's why I can't kill Austen for you—because he isn't breaking them."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"So getting little boys pregnant isn't conspicuous enough for you?" I asked.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I..." She looked genuinely miserable, and didn't say anything.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I knew what she was going to say.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"No one believes in that except you and one woman who's in a mental hospital."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>That was the reason, but she knew how monstrous, how inhuman it would be to say it</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She was a hypocrite.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She was a weakling.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>But she was kind. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>Her kindness made her a hypocrite and a weakling.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>And because of that, I gave up on my species.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Fine, fine. You don't have to say anymore, I understand. So I just need to find proof that Austen is planning something big, right? Something on the scale of taking over an entire village? I think I can get that for you. If I find something, you'll take him out for me?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Still looking miserable, she nodded. "It's a deal."</span></p>

      <div id="chaptertext">
        <p class="standard"><span>The next place I visited was Harrington Hills Trailer Park.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I made sure to bring a carton of cigarettes with me.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Going there presented a bit of a dilemma; unlike the jail and mental hospital, where there were guards and orderlies to protect me from anyone Austen might send after me, Harrington Hills was full of dangerous people running loose. Sophia could protect me, but she would draw attention and possibly bring in extra dangers not sent by Austen. We argued for a while about what to do, but in the end I went in alone and she waited near the entrance in the car, ready to come in if she sensed danger.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I found Amber in her usual LeBaron, this time not cradling her demon child.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>So she was sixteen. I'd thought when I first saw her that she wasn't exactly small for her age, but it seemed she was on the small side after all.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I came up alongside the car and knocked on the window.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Didn't expect to see you here," she said. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I brought your cigarettes, but I didn't think you were serious about the Plan B, since you're so happy with your baby. Or babies, I should say."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I thought you'd be dead and eaten by now."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I had a bodyguard even more bad-ass than an ex-Mossad agent, so I managed to make it," I said.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Yeah, your friend killed my firstborn, the one I told you about. Tell that bitch I'll kill her for that."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The image came to my mind now: Amber, trying to shoot Sophia with a gun held sideways, gangsta-style. Sophia, standing in a hail of bullets, all of them missing. "Say that again when you've killed a few ex-Mossad agents," I said.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Why'd you come here?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Just following up. So, was everything you told me a lie, or just the non-nothing parts?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I didn't lie to you. All that was true. I just didn't mention some of the stuff that happened in between."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"You lied when you said you wanted to get Austen for touching the kids."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Nah, that was true, but I ain't no sucker. I ain't gonna just tell you everything and let the cops take care of it. I wanna get Austen myself."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"And you're doing a fine job of it. I hear performing frequent oral sex on a man will kill him after seventy to eighty years, depending on how old he was when you started."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Oh, shut up. You're just mad 'cause you aren't the one gettin' it."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I'm not into ghetto jailbait."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Why'd you come here, anyway? For real."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"To give you one more chance to do the right thing, and come with me to talk to the police."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Amber laughed. "The cops won't believe me. The TV people wouldn't've believed me either. That's 'cause they ain't suckers like you. I saw how you looked at me from the first second. You were hopin' I was some helpless princess who'd make you my knight in shining freakin' armor for 'rescuing' me from Austen, and then give you a blow job as a reward."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Actually, it was the opposite—you were the one who wanted to do me, from the very beginning," I said. "I could tell. I could smell it. You wanted to drag me into the back of that car and ride me. Because you were playing me. Sex was always your weapon—that was how you played people, how you got them to trust you. It felt unfamiliar, trying to play someone without it. But you succeeded, I won't deny it. I wanted to help you. And I still do."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"You wanna help your own self, you mean, to get Austen off your back," said Amber. "Well, you don't gotta worry. In three days, none of us is gonna have to worry about him anymore."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Score.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>In three days, Austen is planning to make some move.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Amber is planning to take advantage of it somehow.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>And she wants me to be there, probably because I'm the only one who knows about her demon children other than Austen and Sophia.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Hence 'accidentally' dropping a hint about when it would take place.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I got away from her with some moralizing blither about saving the children and feeding the starving and turning water into wine and separating the wheat from the chaff, and returned to the car.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>When Sophia asked what I found out, I told her,</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Something so conspicuous that you'll be begging me to let you kill Austen",</span></p><p class="standard"><span>and then refused to talk about it anymore the rest of the day.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Now I just had to figure out what Austen was planning.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It was a long shot, but I checked the church website first.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>And there it was.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The first thing that appeared was a large picture advertising some event. The lettering was all loopy and fancy, as if someone had learned calligraphy by copying the title cards of old Disney movies and had tried to transfer his skills to community service.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It said "Grab Feed."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>There was a horrible cartoon of a crab in a bib on it, so I assumed it meant "Crab Feed".</span></p><p class="standard"><span>In any case, this event was taking place three days from now.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It was a church event. Austen would be officiating, and giving a service afterward.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>In other words, Austen or someone who worked for him had prepared all the food for this event.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>All the food, and all the drinks.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I remembered what Mrs. Robson had said.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"About four months ago, Austen received a huge crate of Rohypnol from somewhere," she had said. "Our PI took pictures of it and showed them to us. They had somehow disappeared, along with him, by the time of our trial."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I remembered what Sophia had said.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"He's quite weak. He even used a gun. I don't think he can do much more than make demon children."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Austen had tried to feed me to his demon children. Had it been Sophia, she would have just treated my neck like a birthday cake and sliced right through it. But Austen tried to feed me to them. That means he wasn't even confident that he could kill me, a weak human. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>How many demon children had Austen had?</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I hadn't been able to see them, but there were at least five full-grown. I guessed that these were all from Amber, though that wasn't well-supported by evidence.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>According to Mrs. Robson, he had molested around thirty children.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Thirty children could only yield thirty demons.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>And thirty demons was not enough to take over a town, especially when they could be killed so easily. If decapitation could kill them, it seemed likely that enough bullets would also do the job, and this town was lousy with guns.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>But how many people were going to attend this Grab Feed?</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The next day, on the way to school, I presented her with the evidence.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"So you think that Austen is planning to knock out everyone at the dinner with some date rape drug and knock up as many of them as he can, causing them to give birth to demon children three months later, which Austen can then use as an army to take over the town." </span></p><p class="standard"><span>She summed it up.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I asked if that was even a tiny bit plausible.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"He's an incubus, so he should have unbelievable stamina, and he can impregnate men or women, so he doesn't need to care which gender shows up," I said. "And he ordered a crate of Rohypnol. A crate. If he just wanted to rape a few people, he'd only need a few bottles, but he ordered an entire crate."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I don't know..."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Austen's been a pastor in this town for almost ten years. He must have come here specifically because he wanted to build up an army. He chose to be a pastor so people would trust him, knowing that this is a pretty religious town where most people wouldn't believe that the pastor was doing their kids or fraternizing with prostitutes. He probably targeted the children because there were a lot of them, they were easy to get into bed, and they weren't likely to tell anyone they'd given birth to a Satan spawn. Like Mrs. Sullivan said, kids can be cruel to anyone who's different."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Then why try something big now?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"It's too slow. If he makes the after-school program into an orgy, he runs the risk of one of the kids snitching, so he has to go after them when they're alone, and he can't get every kid in the program or someone is going to connect the dots, so he has to do them one or two at a time. Then he has to wait three months for the incubation, and then he has to gamble that the parents don't kill the thing the second it pops out. At first he was only targeting girls so it wouldn't look suspicious if they got pregnant—after all, even very young girls can sometimes get pregnant. But he got desperate and started going after the boys too, and going after too many kids at once, and that's where he slipped up."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"And what about all those women he was seeing?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"According to what Mrs. Robson said, they were mostly hookers and barflies, so they probably got abortions the second they suspected they were pregnant. I doubt Austen realized any recruitment gain from them."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"And in this theory, what is Austen going to do after the Grab Feed?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I had told her that was what it was called.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I couldn't help smiling.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She looked a bit miffed, but continued. "Wouldn't he realize that everyone will suspect he had something to do with it, when each of them—man and woman, young and old—suddenly becomes pregnant after passing out at this Grab Feed?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Most of the people are probably members of his church," I said. "They'd have a mental block against thinking anything bad about him. Sure, they'd probably lose some of their trust in him, but the situation would be so confusing that I doubt they'd immediately blame it on him. It wouldn't be like with Richie Robson, who was conscious when Austen did it. He's probably planning to lay low and let the confusion and fear keep the lynch mob away from his door."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Or he's planning to lead the lynch mob," Sophia suggested. "To make them do what he wants, rather than an army of demon children."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Either way, he's conspicuously exposing the supernatural to a large number of people," I said.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She nodded.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"You're right. I have to investigate this, at least."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>By the way, the cigarettes I had given Amber weren't the little feminine Virginia Slims; they were big, nasty Camel Wides with extra tar and cyanide, perfect for the three pack a day smoker who can't be bothered to smoke three packs anymore to get a nicotine fix.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I figured she could trade them with the people here more easily.</span></p>

      <div id="chaptertext">
        <p class="standard"><span>Either Austen wasn't the vindictive type or he knew that Sophia was protecting me, because for the next three days, nothing happened. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>And then I found myself standing in a room full of sleeping people.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The Grab Feed was being held in the community room of the church. It was a large, high-roofed room with wood floors and a stage, at the moment ringed with folding tables, each one covered with aluminum trays heaped high with crab, steak, prime rib, macaroni and cheese, potato salad, grapes and watermelon, and black-eyed peas. Kegs of free beer and carafes of free wine stood on one table alongside jugs of water and bottles of soda. Even more folding tables filled the center of the room, with folding steel chairs pulled up to them.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The tickets had been thirty-five dollars each, so for the two of us to get in, it had been seventy dollars. I didn't have that kind of money, so it was fortunate that Sophia did. She had given me one Franklin and asked me to handle the details. I had signed us up under the conspicuously false names of Bruce and Naomi Campbell.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Sophia had insisted that we go in disguise, so I was currently wearing a trucker baseball cap that my father kept in the garage for when he wanted to play redneck, a plaid shirt which I had shoved to the back of my closet sometime in middle school and had not unearthed again until now, and the most torn, stained pair of jeans I could find. She was dressed exactly how she usually dressed at school—after all, Austen had only seen her in full succubus form, with red hair and gold eyes, so he was more likely to see through me than her no matter how disguised I was.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She seemed nervous as we came in, her gaze moving over the tables of food, the people milling around and talking, the high ceiling, and the stage. I directed her to a seat. "Come on, it'll look suspicious if we don't eat," I said.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"What if Austen put the drug in the food?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I don't think he'd want everyone conking out at different times like that. Besides, if I pass out, you'll protect me from his lascivious fingers, won't you?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It's not like my family has ever starved, but my mother wasn't much of a cook—limited time and her deficient sense of taste were to blame. After all, she worked, and she was a woman who was perfectly happy to live off the same kind of frozen dinner tray for weeks at a time. So having piles of steak and crab in front of me was sort of a treat, and I wasn't about to pass it up, even if I might get raped after eating it. I grabbed a paper plate and put some of everything on it, dragging along a reluctant Sophia, who would eat steak and grapes but nothing else, saying those two seemed hardest to get drugs into. She also wouldn't drink anything except the water from the drinking fountain outside. On this, I had to agree with her that it was safest to resist, but I couldn't, and had 7-Up, since I didn't want to cloud my wits with wine.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>We had one close call while eating—Austen came around to hobnob with his flock and looked for a moment as if he were going to approach us, but he seemed to decide that he didn't know us and didn't want to, and left to talk to someone else. Even though I wanted the man dead or ruined, I had to admire his social skills; he talked to the attendees, young and old, man and woman, poor and relatively less poor, as if he were genuinely interested in their lives, which he seemed to know quite a lot about in each case. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>Amber was with him. It seemed he'd promoted her to his secretary at some point; he told this to everyone who asked. Some of them congratulated her, and a few of the older women pinched her cheeks, and one of the younger men pinched her bottom. Even before being pinched on any part of her body, she hadn't seemed happy with all the attention and praise she was getting, and had stood in sullen silence while being made a big deal of.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>As the meal was winding down, Austen took the stage and spoke into the microphone. "Good evening everyone, especially everyone I haven't had a chance to talk to yet. I hope you've all enjoyed your meal. The service will begin in a few minutes, but first I'd like to have everyone drink a toast to our troops over in Iraq and Afghanistan. The staff are passing out special champagne right now, and special sparkling apple juice for the under twenty-ones, and when everyone has a glass, we'll drink."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"This is it," I muttered to Sophia. "The food was fine after all; this drink is going to have it."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I wonder if there's enough time to get some crab before they finish passing them out," she muttered back.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>There wasn't; church attendants came by our table and served us Rohypnol-laced drinks just a few seconds after that exchange. Amusingly, they put champagne in front of me, but sparkling apple juice in front of Sophia. Of course no one could possibly guess her real age, but to be that far off was embarrassing for everyone involved.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Once everyone had been served, there was a moment of silence, and then,</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Now everyone, a toast: to our troops, and our military families, and our veterans, who protect our freedom," </span></p><p class="standard"><span>said Austen, raising his own glass and taking a drink.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Everyone except Sophia and me raised a glass and drank, and Austen began the sermon.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>As he spoke, people began to drop off.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It wasn't simultaneous—it couldn't be—but it was close enough.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Also, anyone who went for the doors to try and get help found them to be locked from the outside.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>And so I found myself in a room full of sleeping people.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Fortunately, the food had been cleared away before the service began, so no one passed out into his potato salad.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Once people started to pass out, Sophia had put her head down on the table as if she were also asleep, and I followed her lead. Austen continued to preach, apparently oblivious to everything going on, until it looked like everyone in the room was unconscious.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Then he turned to Amber, and said, "Now we must get to work."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>With my head down on the table, watching from half-opened eyes, I saw the doors open, and in walked a group of those monkey creatures with stingers that lived in the basement. None was as huge as the Sasquatch Sophia had killed to protect me, but six of the group were at least chimpanzee-sized, and there were three more small Capuchin ones like the one that had sprung from Amber's arms and attacked me, and all of them were grinning those horrible grins full of sharp teeth and staring around with those demented eyes, waving their stinger-tipped tails the way gangsters wave their pieces.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>This was unexpected. I'd thought Austen's aim was to make more of those things, which wouldn't require him to bring in the ones he had.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It seemed it was unexpected for Austen as well. "Children!" he called. "You should not be here. Soon you will be able to eat well of fresh meat, but for now return to the basement."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I raised my head from the table. Sophia tried to push it back down, but I shook off her hand and stood up.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I had a premonition.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Amber was going to make her move.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Children, listen to your mom—kill him," said Amber.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Calmly.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Casually.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The nearest chimpanzee jumped onto the stage and swung a giant fist into Austen's stomach. Austen buckled in half.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The others jumped onto the stage. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>The six chimpanzees encircled Austen and pounded on him with their huge fists.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The three Capuchins gnawed at his feet with their sharp teeth.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Austen screamed "No! Stop! Obey me! Children! Listen—you—harlot!" as their huge, hammer-like fists struck him again and again.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>One of the chimpanzees leaned in and bit a chunk of flesh from Austen's shoulder. Blood dribbled down his black shirt and onto the wooden stage. Soon all nine of the creatures were leaning in and biting, tearing hunks of meat from whatever parts of Austen they could reach, dismembering him, eviscerating him, pulling out organs and tissues and tubes, like a horde of children rushing to recover the spoils from a pi<span class="T1">ñ</span><span class="T2">ata.</span></span></p><p class="standard"><span>Now that was a grab feed.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It took about six minutes for Austen to die. He screamed for every nanosecond of it, ordering the children to stop, cursing Amber, cursing me, trying to tell Amber he slept with her mother, trying to tell the demon children he received oral sex from their mother, insisting that they couldn't do this to him, yelling for someone to help him, whining that it can't end like this, threatening Amber that she'd regret betraying him. After five minutes or so he seemed to break, and started talking dirty, saying things like "Oh yeah baby, oh yeah, that's it, harder baby".</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Then one of the demon children leaned in and bit a chunk out of his neck, removing his ability to speak.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>He died shortly after.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Amber descended from the stage, and the children followed her, leaving a bloody mess of shredded meat and broken bones behind them.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>And at that moment, Sophia stood up and tore her clothes off, revealing her Superman suit underneath.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Actually, she fumbled with her shoelaces, hopped on one leg trying to get her jeans off, and then got her hair stuck on a button taking off her jacket, but within one minute she had stripped down to a sort of backless leotard and a pair of tights, which I assumed was her succubus outfit, because as soon as she had finished, her hair turned red, her eyes turned gold, and wings sprang from her back. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>It was almost cool enough to make up for her totally uncool stripping scene a second ago.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Sophia approached Amber, surrounded by a posse of demon children, as they made their way between two rows of tables.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I decided to sit back and watch from my seat, where it was safe.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Amber," said Sophia.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Who're you?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"My name is Sophia. I'm...a friend of James."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I could tell just from the look on Amber's face that whatever Sophia was planning to say wouldn't leave any impression on her.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Nonetheless, she tried.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I'm sorry for what's happened to you. It must have been frightening. But Austen is dead now, and I really, really think that you should tell someone what he did to you, and try to get help. Someone will help you—even if not your mother, someone will."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Even though I wasn't much better, even I found that speech cheesy. Amber just sneered. "My kids will help me. They'll help me with whatever I want. I was gonna have 'em help me kill half the people in here so everyone else will be scared of me and I can rule this town."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I can't let you do that," Sophia replied. The demon children closed up ranks around Amber, but Sophia still looked calm.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"You're the bitch who killed my firstborn, aren't you? Did that needle-dick friend of yours tell you what I said? I'm gonna kill you for that. I'll fuckin' kill you bitch!"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Amber screamed the last sentence, and with that, the children struck.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>They closed in around Sophia, trying to pound her and bite her, just as they had done to Austen. But Sophia wasn't Austen, and before they could close in, she had taken to the air.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Yes, she flew.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I'd heard that she could, but it was still surprising to see someone do it.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Not to be outdone, one of the demon children jumped after her. Its leg strength was incredible—it could jump thirty feet into the air. It swung a huge fist into Sophia's stomach on the way up, then grabbed her and held on, dragging her down to the ground with it and crashing her body into the floor as it landed. With Sophia on the floor, the others closed in and began stomping and pounding on her. I couldn't see that well, but it seemed that the Capuchins were stinging her, while the others were stinging, stomping, and pounding all at once, stabbing their stingers into her back and legs over and over again. The one who had jumped after her was holding her wrists to the floor, crushing them, twisting them, breaking them, keeping those deadly talons from springing out and shredding them all into ribbons.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>This looked bad.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Sophia could regenerate from injuries, but for how long, and up to how much damage?</span></p><p class="standard"><span>How long could she survive this nine-on-one beating?</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Amber had come to gloat.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"You ain't so tough." She glanced at me. "More bad-ass than a Mossad agent, you said? I don't know what that is, but looks like my kids are even more bad-ass than that."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I got up from my chair, where it was safe.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I looked around, searching for a weapon.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>My chair.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I seized the folding metal chair and, resisting the insane desire to yell "Can you smell what The Rock is cooking?", I ran at Amber, swinging it by its legs straight at her head.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I guess she hadn't expected any danger from me, because she just stared at me stupidly until the chair slammed into her face. I heard something crack, and when I pulled the chair back for another blow, her pretty face had turned into a mess of blood, with her nose as its faucet.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I swung again, hitting Amber in the stomach and flattening her.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I raised the chair again and hit her across the back.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I really did have a purpose for this. I wasn't just beating a sixteen-year-old girl with a folding metal chair to make myself feel strong.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>My purpose came to fruition when I raised the chair to land a fourth blow.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The demon children, realizing their dear mother was being attacked, had left Sophia to come to her side.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I was probably dead now. Really, this time for real. Even if Sophia could recover from her wounds enough to kill all nine of these things, she probably couldn't do it fast enough to save me. I wouldn't last for six minutes like Austen. I was just a human. One punch from one of those chimpanzees would kill me.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>However, I had only minor regrets. After all, I never thought a useless guy like me would get to die saving half of a roomful of sleeping people from being eaten by demon monkeys. I had always thought I would die meaninglessly in a ditch somewhere, and my corpse would wash down a storm drain like garbage, so getting to go out saving a bunch of people wasn't so bad.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>That's what I honestly thought at that time.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>And that huge fist was only about half a second from crushing my spine.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>But I hadn't known just how fast a succubus could recover.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>And even as I was thinking such things, the fist bearing down on me suddenly detached from the arm driving it.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Then the arm detached from the body.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Then all the pieces of the body detached from each other.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>In a whirling flash of talons, Sophia ran straight into the group of demon children, coming at them from behind. They'd been moving to surround me, and she'd followed them, first cutting to pieces the one about to attack me, then rushing into the thick of things. One, then two, then three, then four of the chimpanzees were cut into shreds, and that succubus, that normally gentle, somewhat airheaded computer nerd succubus, was spinning around like a food processor blade, turning those demon monkeys into demon monkey julienne. The cuts her talons made were so precise that no blood came from them until the pieces hit the ground, where they burst and sprayed fluid everywhere.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Raising my folding metal chair, I saw one of the smaller Capuchins trying to crawl at Sophia and sting her, and I slammed the chair into its back as hard as I could, repeatedly, until it stopped moving. It wasn't dead, but it seemed that even demon Capuchin monkeys had backs which could be broken to stop them from moving.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>In the time it took me to break the Capuchin's back, Sophia had already sliced all six chimpanzees into ribbons and decapitated the other two Capuchins. She stood next to Amber, hunched over in a sea of her beloved demon children's blood, with not a drop on her. Her leotard and tights were as black as they'd been when she clumsily stripped down to them a few minutes ago.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Are you all right, James?" she asked me.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Just to make sure, I hit the broken-backed Capuchin one more time. "I think so."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I'd like to think it was the one that stung me.</span></p>

      <div id="chaptertext">
        <p class="standard"><span>Well, that about wraps things up.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Amber had had the demon children kill all the church workers who'd been guarding the doors for Austen, so that had only left the sleeping Grab Feed attendees to worry about as far as witnesses, and they were all sound asleep anyway.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>We'd checked most of the church for signs of any other demon children, but it seemed that only Amber had actually given hers to Austen. Who knew what had happened to the ones born by C-section from the boys or the ones born from all those girls Austen had abused over his ten years of army-building, but the parents must have gotten rid of them somehow, and good riddance.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Once Amber had recovered a bit from my chair attack, she'd started screaming that she was going to call the cops on us and have us locked up for murder. By this time, Sophia had put her clothes back on and once again looked harmless and mousy, so I returned the sneer Amber had given me and said,</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Try it. See if the police will take the word of a trailer park strumpet who rented herself out to an incubus as a demon factory that a fine, upstanding young college student like this here girl"—and here I gestured towards Sophia as if I were Vanna White showing off the new Camaro you would win for making it to the final round—"murdered the local pastor when there's no apparent motive and neither hide nor hair of a murder weapon",</span></p><p class="standard"><span>causing Amber to shoot me a dirty look. I felt a little bad for taking so many cheap shots at her—with both my words and the folding metal chair—but she tried to kill my friend, so I felt we were even.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Of course, for the very same reasons the police would never believe we'd murdered those people, we could hardly hand Amber over to the police; there was no evidence that she'd killed Austen or those church workers, and without the extra assumption of the demon children, it seemed highly unlikely that she'd be able to kill an adult man in the way those men had been killed. As unsatisfying as it was, Amber was getting out of this scot-free too.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>As a final insult, Sophia had tried to comfort Amber as she sat in the pile of blood and monkey parts, placing a hand on her shoulder and saying,</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I'm sorry. They were demons, and they were Austen's, but they were your babies, and I know that. I didn't want to hurt you like this, but I couldn't allow them to kill any of these people. I hope that you understand why what you did and what you were planning to do were wrong",</span></p><p class="standard"><span>as if she were speaking to a five-year-old who had hit her friend over a toy and gotten a time-out. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>Amber seemed to somehow understand the role she was playing, because she just screamed "I hate you, bitch!" and broken down into tears, and Sophia had looked at me for help, genuinely puzzled by the failure of her preschool teacher techniques.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>That's exactly why I don't go for jailbait.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>They may have the bodies of sexy women, but they have the minds of spoiled children.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>While Amber bawled like a baby, I had filled some large Ziploc bags with leftover food to bring home with me. No point in letting it go to waste.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Then we left.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>When we pulled into the driveway of my house, I said, "Listen, I kind of owe you, so don't get the wrong idea here, but if you're too tired to drive home, you could probably sleep in my room. I'll go in the living room."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She refused, but added, with a smile, "That's nice of you" and petted me on the head like a cat again.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The next morning.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The first thing I did was check the morning news broadcast. Sure enough, the bloody massacre at the Grab Feed was all over the headlines. It seemed that after everyone had woken up, someone had mentioned to the police that Amber was gone, and they'd gone and picked her up as a person of interest, so she was in custody now. Some of the people who were there had managed to convince themselves that there had been a drive-by shooting, so Austen was being memorialized as the tragic victim of gang violence, even though just looking at his corpse would show that no Tek-9 had done that.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The second thing I did was pick up the phone.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Hello, Sullivan Residence," June Sullivan answered.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"June, this is James Moran."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I expected her to hang up right away, but she didn't.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>However, she did say "What can I do for you?" a bit stiffly, as if I were an annoying telemarketer.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I guess that's about the best treatment I could hope for.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I asked if she'd heard about what happened to Austen. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>She had.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I asked if her son had been pregnant.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>He had.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I told her about Wenjing Robson.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I'm asking you, begging you to go to the police about what happened to your son, for Mrs. Robson's sake. Austen destroyed many lives and killed many people, but if you come forward, you can help fix some of that. You can help get Mrs. Robson out of the mental hospital and back to her son. Please, consider it."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>For a second I thought she'd hung up on me, but then she spoke again. "You know, I was hitting on you when you were here."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Gee, I hadn't noticed.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I have this fantasy."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I don't think I want to hear about this.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Where a pure young boy—a Mormon missionary, or a Boy Scout troop leader, something like that—comes to my house. I thought you were a pure young boy. But you're a filthy adult, just like the rest of us."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I'm honored.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>After that, she hung up.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>But I heard six weeks later that Wenjing Robson's case had come up for appeal and she'd managed to get herself released from the mental hospital, and was working on getting her son back, so in the end it seems Mrs. Sullivan was able to separate her feelings about the request from her feelings about the requester.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>For some reason, my mother and sisters had the day off. It was probably some minor holiday like Boxing Day or something, but the college didn't observe it so I hadn't expected them all to be there when I came down. When I saw them gathered around the table having a late breakfast, I decided that I was going to celebrate Boxing Day too.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>That lasted until a navy blue Audi pulled into the driveway.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Who is that?" my mother asked as Sophia got out of the car, once again dressed in a stylish jacket and sunglasses.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"That must be James's girlfriend," said Sue. "The one I told you about. The computer nerd."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"How nice of her to drive all the way here to pick you up. She must like you a lot. Make sure she never finds out what your personality is like, okay?" said my mother.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"She isn't my girlfriend, and should a mother be saying things like that to her son? Anyway, I'm taking the day off, so tell her to go away."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I am not telling that poor girl to leave after she came here to pick you up," said my mother. "Get upstairs and get dressed right now, and I'll go tell her that it'll be a few minutes."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I grudgingly obeyed, going upstairs to change out of my pajamas, and watched from my window as my mother went out to speak to Sophia. Damn that computer nerd succubus. I had been trying to keep her away from my family, but she'd managed to meet them anyway. I imagined the conversation they were probably having down there.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Sorry for my idiot son troubling you so often," my mother was probably saying.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Oh no, <span class="T2">it's no trouble at all," Sophia was probably replying. "Someday, when I drain all his life force and extend my own existence for another few decades, it will all become worth it."</span></span></p><p class="standard"><span>But still, I felt a little bad.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>That's why, once my mother had forced me to get in her car and be driven to school, I said the following:</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I should apologize to you, I guess."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"For what?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"You're right, I guess I should make clear which of my many transgressions I'm apologizing for.  You see...running around this town, reporting on things, I've seen a lot of deception."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Living for two hundred years, I've also seen a lot of deception."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Then you know that people who are as good as their word are rare, right?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"No, I've met a few people who said they were going to rape and kill me, and they did their best to do it."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Wouldn't that be more like being as bad as their word?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"It depends on whether 'as good as your word' means 'doing exactly what you say' or 'carrying through the moral implications of what you say', and I took the meaning as the former."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Then I'll rephrase—you know that people who say they'll do something good and then actually do it are rare, right?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Yes."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"And you know that people who say they'll do something good and then don't do it are common, right?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Yes."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Did you also know that Greenland is owned by Denmark?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I did."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"And Guam is a protectorate of the US?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I knew that."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"And Libya was once an Italian colony?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I remember it."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"And the British Virgin Isles are British?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I never would have thought otherwise."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"And the Vatican is its own country?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"One of the richest in the world."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I didn't actually know any of that, so I was confirming with you that what I had heard was true."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She looked happy. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>I had noticed before that she looked happy when we were carrying on sustained pointless blather like this, but I had thought it was some sort of act or pose so she could suck out my life force.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It wasn't. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>I remembered how bored, how sad, how uninterested she had looked when walking with the country-looking fellow into the park that would be the last thing he ever saw.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She wasn't that good of an actress.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She was genuinely happy.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>That's why I felt guilty, and said this:</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"You're rare."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Because I'm a succubus?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Because you were as good as—no, better than your word. You said you wouldn't hurt me, and you haven't. More than that, you saved me."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>That's right. I wouldn't be here if not for her.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I wouldn't have school to skip if not for her.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I wouldn't have a sister to love if not for her.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I wouldn't have a mother to complain about me if not for her.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I wouldn't have a mouth to eat with, or fingers to type with, or a tongue to speak with, or a mind to think with, if not for her.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She saved my life.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"But even though you turned out to be a good person, I was suspicious of you. Even you must know that girls don't really go for guys like me, so when you first talked to me, I thought you were setting me up for a humiliation. That's why I followed you and found out what you really are. Then it turned out you were the good one, and the one who was playing me was Amber, who I never suspected. So I'm sorry I misjudged you so badly."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>I couldn't say such embarrassing things while looking at her, so I had been looking out the window of the car as trees and fields sped by. That's why I didn't notice it right away when she didn't reply.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Are you...crying?"</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"No," she insisted.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She was totally crying.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I'm the one who wants to cry! I almost died twice in the past week, then I had to admit my own worthlessness as a reporter, <span style=" font-style:italic; " class="T1">and </span><span class="T2">say embarrassing things to you, of all people! What have you got to cry about? Did I say something thoughtless? I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry for everything. Just throw me out of the car right here."</span></span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I'm not crying," she insisted, sniffling.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Then you need to put your glasses back on, because your driving is getting pretty erratic here."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She pulled over the car next to the freeway, and we sat there for a few minutes while she cried, insisting every time I brought it up that she wasn't crying.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Since she's attractive, you might have thought she would cry daintily—a few tears on her cheeks, a few feminine moans. Nothing of the sort. She cried with her whole face scrunched up, her eyes red, her face covered in a mixture of tears and snot. I dug in the glove compartment and, finding a few napkins, offered them to her.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I'm not crying," she insisted, turning her face away from me and wiping it with the napkins.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>When she was done not crying, she started the car and got back on the freeway. We traveled along in silence for a while. Then she said</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I haven't had anyone say anything that embarrassing to me in decades. The emotion overtook me. I'm sorry."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"So you admit that you were crying."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I'll never admit to that."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>She's really not a good actress. It's no wonder she failed her audition to become the new Elizabeth Taylor.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Also, it seems she's surprisingly weak against emotional stuff.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"Anyway, it seems I'm going to be here for a while," she continued. "If you feel grateful to me, you could repay me by helping me out with future investigations."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Future investigations.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>So there were more freaky creatures like her and Austen living in this town, waiting to kill me.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I look forward to working with you, James."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>"I look backward to not working with you, Sophia."</span></p><p class="standard"><span>But she looked happy even as I said this, and I thought that if a worthless piece of garbage like me could make a cute girl smile, maybe that wasn't so bad.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Even if the cute girl was a two hundred-year-old infernal creature who seduced men so she could steal their life force.</span></p>

        <p class="standard"><span>Successful people are all the same; they succeeded because they had talent, ambition, drive, perseverance, and lots of help. Failures are all different. Some failures failed because they had no talent, others because they had no ambition, others because they had no drive, or did not persevere, and some failed because they had no help, or their help wasn't helpful enough, or wasn't the right kind of help. On the other hand, some failures fail because they had too much talent, or too much ambition, or too much drive, or too much perseverance, or too much help. There are even people who, to an outside observer, may seem to have succeeded, but in actuality have failed, simply because they believe themselves to have failed.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Thus far, I have been a failure as a writer.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The first time, I failed because I had no talent.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The second time, I failed because I had no ambition.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>The third time, I failed because I had no talent and no help, but too much ambition, drive, and perseverance.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>There were many smaller failures in between.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>This book may also be a failure. If so, it will fail in a way that no one could have foreseen, and that's the fascinating thing about failures, making them much more interesting for those who do nothing but watch and criticize. </span></p><p class="standard"><span>But in one way, it has succeeded over most of my other work: it exists. Many of the others, first and foremost, failed at existing.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>After ten years of work, ten years of misguided efforts, ten years of wasted hours and broken keyboards, I finished something.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>It may be worthless. It may be the worst thing ever written, even if one considers the works of Hiro Mashima as literature. It may be a failure. Maybe I had no talent, or no drive, or no ambition. Maybe I lacked help. Maybe, conversely, I surfeited. But here it is.</span></p><p class="standard"><span>Something you can call a finished book.</span></p>
