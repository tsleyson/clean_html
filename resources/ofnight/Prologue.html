The crazy loser with no friends, who runs around town chasing rumors and gossip and can't stop challenging everyone's favorite English literature teacher, is not a popular guy. That's why I was suspicious. It's unusual for anyone, especially a girl, especially a reasonably good-looking sort of girl like her, to go out of her way to talk to the crazy loser with no friends and tell him she agrees with his interpretation of a piece of literature. </span></p><p class="Standard"><span> It's unusual for anyone.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I'd be suspicious of anyone.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> But, well, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't extra suspicious because she was a reasonably good-looking sort of girl.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I couldn't even imagine what she might be trying to get out of me with her feminine wiles, but I'd determined that I wouldn't let it work. I might make a fool of myself constantly, but still, no one was going to make a fool of me.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> That's why, when I saw her coming out of that bar on the other side of the road, I followed her.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> After all, I'm a reporter (after a fashion). Gathering information is what I do. And if someone's trying to manipulate me, I'd like to know a little more about them.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> That's why, when I saw a reasonably good-looking sort of girl who I suspected of trying to use feminine wiles on me coming out of a scummy dive bar on the other side of the road, accompanied by the sort of man who hangs out in scummy dive bars, I followed her.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I followed her, that girl who didn't look like she belonged in a scummy dive bar, and the man who did look like he belonged in one, through the warm early summer evening. l followed them through the well-lit main streets of the nightlife area of Santa Robles, an area I had come through only because it completely encircled the college, like a wall protecting the students from staying home and studying. Back towards the college, towards the small park on the edge of campus. Past a sign that read "Closes at sundown". </span></p><p class="Standard"><span> She wasn't smiling.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> She wasn't laughing.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> In fact, she looked like she was headed to a funeral.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> The man was smiling.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> The man was laughing. Mostly at his own jokes.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I noticed how he kept a tight hold on her arm the whole time, as if he expected her to try and run away. </span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I followed them to a picnic table, by now pretty sure what was about to happen. I thought about leaving. I thought about whether staying would make me a pervert. I thought about my night-vision camera, at home in my desk drawer. </span></p><p class="Standard"><span> If she was planning to manipulate me, this was enough to destroy her. College students are fundamentally high school students on an ego trip. Just the rumor that this girl was the sort who would take a redneck in his forties from a dive bar into the park and let him do whatever he wanted would be enough to destroy her reputation. A few pictures could really seal the deal.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I wondered if there was enough starlight for my camera to capture anything.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> As it turned out, what she said to me in the library that day was one of the only things she didn't lie about. Or at least, lie by omission about.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> She submitted herself with a "Please be gentle, it's my first time," and the whole process began. It took him about twelve minutes to finish. Twelve minutes, that's not bad. At least he had some stamina.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Then he died screaming.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> It took him twelve minutes to finish having his way with the girl. It took him three seconds to finish becoming a corpse. I panicked.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I took a picture.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> When she saw the flash, she looked up. I took another one, and turned around, running through the bushes as fast as I could, just wanting to get out of there, just wanting to reach the light of the nightlife district, just wanting to get home.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> You may not believe this, coming from the sort of pervert who would stay and watch that, but I spent most of the time focusing on her face. I wanted to see what her mindset was, what sort of expression a reasonably good-looking girl makes while submitting her body to a total stranger on a picnic table in a park.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> She looked bored.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Bored, and a little sad.</span></p></body></html>
