It was almost painfully normal. A well-manicured lawn, a concrete driveway, a garage with two cars parked inside, lawn gnomes, roses planted along the front wall. If the spirit of normalcy had a home, this was it.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I rang the doorbell, expecting an older woman to come to the door, hear why I had come, and shut the door in my face. Instead, a woman who was probably in her mid-thirties, with blonde hair cut in a bob, answered the door and said "Yes? Something I can help you with?" as if she genuinely wanted to help me.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I introduced myself and explained that I was here to ask some questions for a news story. I avoided saying anything about her son being pregnant. After all, even I have that much sense. I simply said I had heard about several children being withdrawn from school with strange medical conditions and was doing an investigation. To my surprise, Mrs. Sullivan did not shut the door in my face or tell me to get the hell off her property. Instead, she invited me inside, sat me down at the kitchen table with a glass of iced tea, and told me to call her "June" instead of "Mrs. Sullivan".</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Hearing 'Mrs. Sullivan' makes me feel so old," she explained. "My mother in law is 'Mrs. Sullivan'."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "I see."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "So, James, what sort of questions would you like to ask me?" She smiled warmly. "By the way, if the tea isn't sweet enough for you, I can add more sugar."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "No, it's fine. Anyway, I hear that you withdrew your son from school because of some sort of medical condition."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "That's correct."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "What sort of condition was it?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "That's a...sensitive issue, James. It's something I'd rather not talk about. Something that could be embarrassing for my son." She sat down across from me and touched my left arm. "You understand, don't you? How cruel children can be."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Of course. If you'd rather not talk to me--"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Oh, of course I'll talk to you. It's only, I'd like you to keep us anonymous. You know, like in magazines, when the name has the little star next to it."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "As I said, I'm investigating this as part of a series of incidents, so it may not even be necessary to mention a name." </span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "But if you do give one, you'll give a starred name?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Of course."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Mrs. Sullivan gave a theatrical sigh of relief. "My son started to behave strangely. He had always been a happy child, but he began to show signs of depression. And he started to hurt himself. My husband and I thought he might be having problems at school, and we looked into changing schools, but my cousin is a therapist, and she advised us to find mental health help for him. We found a local therapist, who referred us to a psychiatrist, and the psychiatrist advised removing him from school for a short time to deal with the symptoms."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Do you know if any of the other children who were withdrawn had symptoms like that?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "I know of three. The first was Amber Linney. I...don't like to speak badly of others, but Jane Linney isn't a very good mother, and Amber has pretty much raised herself, so none of us were very surprised when she left school. But then the Thompsons and the Patels took their children out of school; the Thompsons claimed their son had appendicitis, and the Patels claimed tonsillitis, but they've been out of school for over a month, and it doesn't take that long to recover from minor diseases like those, does it?'</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I had no idea how long it took to recover from tonsillitis or appendicitis, so Mrs. Sullivan's speculation wasn't of much use to me. I noticed that her hand had moved from my arm to my hand. She was petting the back of my hand like a hamster. It wasn't that I found her touch particularly distasteful, but this conversation was going in a weird direction, and I decided the best thing would be to bail, quickly. I asked my last question, with every intention of escaping after that.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Was there any change at school just before your son's symptoms developed?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "I can't think of anything, no." </span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "And was there any connection at all between your son, the Thompsons' and Patels' children, and Amber Linney?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Mrs. Sullivan thought for a moment, her hand still rubbing mine. I drained the glass of tea and noticed that I had been tapping my fingers on the table without realizing it. "The only connection I can think of is the after-school program."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Tell me about it." Quickly. And stop rubbing my hand. Of course, saying such a thing would put a damper on her cooperation, so I didn't. But still, this visit was going in a weird direction, and I wanted to end it before it reached a weird destination.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "It was run by Pastor Austen, from the World of Light Church. It was sort of like Sunday school five days a week, but Pastor Austen would also sometimes have the children do volunteer work in the community. Amber was sort of like his assistant."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> After finding out where Amber Linney lived, I nodded and stood up, perhaps a bit too abruptly.  "Thank you very much for your help, Mrs. Sul—June."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Is that all? Well, please come back if you have any more questions."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "I will. Thank you for the tea, it was delicious."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> With that, I fled from that painfully normal house with as much speed as I dared. If Sophia Frenchy-Face's motives were entirely mysterious, it seemed plain enough what Mrs. Sullivan's angle was: she wanted to ensure anonymity for herself and her son. She had decided that it would be easier to obtain by getting on my good side than by slamming the door in my face, and had apparently decided, like Frenchy, that I looked like a pathetic sort who would be easiest to sway with feminine wiles and innuendo. I couldn't really fault her conclusion, since I also thought that I looked like a pathetic sort who could easily be swayed by feminine wiles. </span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Satisfied with my conclusion, I put Mrs. Sullivan out of my mind and focused on Amber Linney. If I heard anything from her about this Pastor Austen, I'd probably pay him a visit too, but in the meantime, I had chosen Amber Linney of the three that Mrs. Sullivan had mentioned because of her lack of parental supervision. My talk with Mrs. Sullivan hadn't been completely fruitless, but I had known better than to ask her permission to speak with her son; it would not be given. I had thought I would probably have to ambush the kid somewhere and try to talk to him, but Amber Linney was the perfect alternative; even if she happened to be with her mother right now, I could probably count on finding a time when she would be alone and unsupervised, when I might be able to get a firsthand account out of her.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> So for that reason, I headed for Harrington Hills Trailer Park, which was outside of Santa Robles. I was actually going back the way I had come, towards the college, but I had an unlimited bus pass and nothing better to do. My nightly call to Lucy was usually made around eight, and since I hadn't worked on my notes at all, I was thinking about ditching her tonight, though I felt guilty about the disappointment I would cause her, my dearest sister who had stuck near to the phone instead of going out with her friends just to speak with me. But, being the sort of terrible person who is constantly disappointing everyone, this feeling was far from alien to me. In fact, my sister was so dear to me because she had endured so many disappointments, and yet had never even considered abandoning me; I could not even hope to put into words my gratitude to her, so instead I decided to show it by actions and headed for the nearest bus stop to got on a bus heading for the outskirts of Santa Robles.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> It was a forty-five minute bus ride to the middle of Santa Robles, where the college was, and I had to walk for another half-hour or so, since I wasn't familiar with this area and didn't want to get on a bus going in the wrong direction. Eventually, I reached Harrington Hills Trailer Park.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I had never been here before, so I had no image of a trailer park except what I had seen in movies and on television.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Those depictions on movies and television are wrong.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I'd like to say they were unjust libel against a lot of hardworking, honest people, but the evidence of my eyes, ears, and nose suggested the movies and television shows had gone easy on the people who lived here, or else the writers of those movies and television shows had only visited the richer sort of trailer park.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> As soon as I walked in, the faint scent of raw sewage and industrial chemicals wafted at me on an ill-met wind. Even though it was summer and no rain had fallen in months, the trailer park sat in a pit of thick, viscous mud that stuck to everything like glue. Every trailer and car I saw had a skirt of black mud around the bottom. Fortunately, I had worn my cheap tennis shoes and wasn't very concerned if they were ruined. My mother had a nose like a bloodhound, and if even a hint of raw sewage and industrial chemicals remained on my shoes or clothes after coming here, she would make me throw out the offending items.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> People were sitting and laying in the mud, leaned against piles of wreckage that looked to be composed of thirty percent scrap metal, twenty percent rotting plywood, and fifty percent cigarette butts, empty beer bottles, and chip bags, with trace amounts of other kinds of junk. I understood why the children would sit in the mud like that—actually, from the look in their eyes, I understood why the adults were doing it as well. </span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Any adult who was halfway conscious was glaring at me with suspicion. Probably they thought I was some sort of police officer. I suppose in their position I'd also think I was some sort of police officer, and also I would want to resist the urge to look at my most valued possession that most people experience when they think that possession might be threatened, because the possession was probably a meth lab.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> All in all, it was a place smothered by dirt and desperation. I could see why an objective observer like Mrs. Sullivan would call Jane Linney a bad mother for raising her daughter in such a place, though I also thought that perhaps Jane Linney had her reasons and it was wrong to judge her. </span><span> Either way, I was the scumbag taking advantage of the fact that Jane Linney had chosen to raise her daughter in a place like this, so I guess that makes me worse than the most degenerate drug addict in this place.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I searched for someone I could ask about Amber Linney's whereabouts. At first I considered one of the children, but none of them looked like they would talk to me—in fact, the two I tried asking stared at me like I was a pedophile and ran away. Well, that was probably the correct response to strange adults for a child living in a place like this. So instead, I found the weakest looking adult I could—one that I could probably outrun, or even outfight. He was lying in the mud with his head resting on a pile of empty burlap sacks, but his eyes were open, and he was clutching a bottle of something wrapped in a brown paper bag. That was somewhat encouraging—maybe he wasn't a drug addict, but merely an alcoholic.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Excuse me," I said. "Could you tell me where Amber Linney is?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "What are you, a kiddie cop?" my chosen guide asked in response. "Gonna take her from her mother again?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "I'm—from the school." I deliberately chose a role which I felt was likely to be nonthreatening. No cop, just a teacher. Just a weak teacher, no gun, no baton, no handcuffs, no reading Miranda rights. "I just want to talk to her."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Huh. Well, if you was gonna take her, I could tell you some things, maybe help you out a little, if you'd help me. Like the time I shared a bottle of Wild Turkey with her. Maybe I could tell you about that, in exchange for another bottle of Turkey. How's that?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> That would actually get him in trouble, not Jane Linney, but I didn't bother telling him that. Instead, I took ten dollars from my pocket. "Okay, I've got one Hamilton here. Mr. Hamilton says he's willing to buy you a bottle of something if you'll tell me where Amber Linney is."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> My guide leered at me and sat up, with some effort. "Go that way." He pointed behind me, to my left. "If you go far enough, you'll come to a place where there ain't no trailers, just some storage sheds and a bunch of wrecked cars. Last I knew, she was in one of them wrecked cars."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I was about to hand him the ten, but upon finishing his speech, he immediately passed out, and I wasn't exactly swimming in a tub of money myself these days, so I decided to do what Scrooge McDuck would have and retain the services of Mr. Hamilton. </span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I followed my guide's instructions and walked down the row of trailers. Looking at them as I passed, I could see that while many of the trailers were wrecks eaten through by rust, some of them were merely dirty and only needed a good scrubbing to look somewhat respectable. The trailers which were merely dirty seemed to all have old but serviceable pickup trucks parked next to them, while the true wrecks either had no car or a heap of rust so distraught it made the trailer itself look like Mrs. Sullivan's sickeningly normal suburban house. Some of them emitted a much stronger stench of industrial chemicals, and I assumed these were the ones where methamphetamine was cooked.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Then, abruptly, the line of trailers stopped, capped by a dilapidated wooden shed. The door hung open, and inside I could see a hammer, sickle, crowbar, axe, and screwdriver, all impossibly rusted, hanging on the wall above an ancient lawnmower. This shed presumably belonged to the superintendent of the park. As there was no grass, I imagined the lawnmower and sickle didn't see much use, but the state of disrepair led me to believe the other tools weren't used much for fixing things either. They had probably been used against those late on their rent more recently than they had been used to fix anything.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> Beyond this shed was, as my guide had suggested, an empty field full of broken cars. Like everything else in Harrington Hills, they were mostly rust, though broken glass clung to the window frames of some of them. Also, some community-minded person had taken it upon himself to decorate most of them using a can of spray paint. His artistic style showed a clear influence from hip-hop and guerrilla art, and his use of color was most impressive.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I began to search the wrecked cars, wondering how they got away with calling this place Harrington Hills when I hadn't seen anything like a hill the whole time. As I weaved through the piles of metal and broken glass, I noticed there was actually some grass here. I could certainly see how this would be a good place for a young girl to escape to; for one thing, there didn't seem to be anyone asleep on the ground here. Maybe they had a religious fear of this place. Perhaps it was like Mr. MacGregor's garden for them. And some of these cars had been nice at one point, so there was probably one with pretty decent upholstery around here somewhere, a comfortable seat to rest in. Making use of that reasoning, I started looking for cars with nice upholstery, but my knowledge of car models is somewhere between nonexistent and fraudulent, falling in the existence spectrum between Nessie and the Cottingley fairies, so I soon gave up and just looked for a girl in the car.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> It took me about twenty minutes of searching before I saw a blonde head in a red Chrysler LeBaron festooned with Bush/Quayle bumper stickers, at which time I realized that I could have just called out her name. Then again, I remembered how the children I had tried to speak to had reacted to me. But Amber sure had chosen a well-hidden car; it was deep within the auto graveyard, and the windows were so grimy that if her hair weren't so bright blonde, and if she hadn't happened to move just as I was looking, I never would have seen her. </span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I came up along the driver's side window and knocked on the door. "Amber Linney?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> She jumped, clearly surprised to see me, and rolled down the window with some effort. She was a pretty child, with blue eyes alongside the bright blonde hair that had given away her position, and a noble cast to her face, as if meant to live a life in which she had everything and nothing was satisfactory. She didn't deserve to grow up in this place. Not that ugly children deserved to grow up in this place either.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> She was older than I'd expected. I'd thought she would be at most eleven or twelve, but she looked just a little younger than my sister Sue, fourteen or fifteen. And she was glaring at me with the same suspicion as the people from the entrance, but also with a dirty look that suggested speaking to me was beneath her.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Who're you?" she asked.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "My name is James. I'm sort of a reporter. I work on local news stories and post them on the Internet. Are you Amber?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "That's right."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "I had a hard time finding you."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "That's because I was hiding." Her glare intensified.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Oh."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "I heard you coming, so I headed deeper in. Figured this car was the best hiding spot, but it's too hard to hear through it."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "I see."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "So whaddya want?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "I heard you've been out of school a lot recently."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Yeah, so? That ain't news."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Not just you. Three other kids, younger than you. I heard that the four of you were involved in Pastor Austen's after-school program."</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Austen? Yeah, he was greasing his pole on me. Thought it was just me. I didn't know he went after the younger kids. Who'd he get?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "Will you answer my questions if I tell you?"</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> I didn't really think this would work; her question seemed like it came from idle curiosity more than concern. When her glare somehow got even more intense, I thought she was about to yell at me and run off, or possibly slam the car door in my face. However, I was in for a surprise.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span> "I think kiddie bangers should have their balls twisted off, <span class="T1">James</span><span class="T2">." For some reason she spat my name with contempt, as if she suspected me of banging kiddies on the side. "I'm one thing, but going after the kids is just wrong. So tell me, don't tell me, either way I'll answer your goddamn questions."</span></span></p><p class="P1"><span> I told her. When she heard the name of Sullivan, her lip curled as if in ironic mirth. "So Austen was a fag too? He was after the boys too? Well, can't say I didn't see that coming."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "What do you mean?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Amber patted the passenger seat of the LeBaron. "Sit down, James. This is gonna take a minute."</span></p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1"><span> I didn't trust her. She wasn't exactly small for her age, so I probably couldn't have thrown her very far, but I didn't trust her even as far as I could throw her.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> But her story was too intriguing to pass up. Even if it was all a lie, even if she had made it up out of pure malice, it wasn't something I could just ignore.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> And if it was true, it was the sort of thing that a comfortable suburban housewife like Mrs. Sullivan never would have told me. Even if she knew it.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Amber Linney had never known her father, or so she told me. He'd run off before she was born, and possibly didn't even know he had a daughter. Her mother, Jane Linney, had raised her in that trailer park alone. When Amber was young, Jane had done her best. She'd worked two jobs, Walmart during the day and a bar in Santa Robles at night, to afford rent, food, and clothing for the two of them. And she had made a point of bring Amber to church every Sunday, to the World of Light Church.</span></p><p class="Standard"><span class="T2">        Whenever Jane couldn't look out for her, the pastor, Joseph Austen, would take care of Amber. He saw her through Jane's breakdown, when the stress got to be too much and Jane started drinking heavily. He saw her through Jane's second breakdown, when the drinking got to be too much and Jane started using crack cocaine and methamphetamine heavily. He somehow found a way to provide food </span><span class="T2">and clothes for her when Jane quit both of her jobs and started turning tricks in exchange for alcohol, crack cocaine, and methamphetamine. He had even given her the job as assistant supervisor of the </span><span class="T2">after-school program, and paid her a little so she could have some freedom.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> The touching had started last year, when Amber was thirteen. One day, in his office, Austen had given Amber a cell phone for her birthday. She was grateful. She'd been wanting one for a while, but no store would sell her one without any credit history. When she told Austen how grateful she was, he told her there was a way she could repay the favor. A few minutes later, she was naked and on her knees. A graphic description of what exactly she did in this state had followed, but I'll omit it here.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> A short while after the touching started, Amber had been sent to the hospital with an envelope of money and instructed to give it to Mr. and Mrs. Robson. They were members of the congregation, and their son was in the hospital. Amber assumed the money was a gift from the church to help them pay for their son's surgery. She had gone up to Richard Robson's room and found a doctor, but no Mr. or Mrs. Robson. Out of curiosity, she'd asked the doctor what kind of surgery Richie was getting. And the doctor had replied that it was a Cesarean section, with a weird expression on his face.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Amber had waited, and soon Mr. Robson returned. She gave him the envelope, but he didn't seem happy or grateful. Instead, he looked angry. He wouldn't take the money, and told her to bring it back to Pastor Austen and tell him they knew he'd done this somehow and they were going to press charges. Amber had done just that, confused, and Pastor Austen had just laughed and said they should have taken the money.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Richie Robson never came back to school or church.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> His parents also disappeared. They never pressed charges.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> A short while later, Amber had asked the school nurse what a Cesarean section was for. The nurse told her it was for getting out babies when something went wrong and they couldn't be born properly. Amber had always thought only girls could have babies. </span></p><p class="P1"><span> She'd been right, of course. It was a biological impossibility.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> A little after that, Amber herself became pregnant.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I looked in books," she said. "I read the little booklets they gave us at school. It said your period ends when you're pregnant. That's how I knew I was. But I never got big or anything. And it's supposed to take nine months, but it only took me about three."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "What happened to the baby?" I asked.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Amber smirked. "I don't even know if you could call that thing a baby," she said. "It looked like some kinda monster. It was all grey and shriveled and hairless. It had a tail."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "What happened to it?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I left it in one of the cars. Way over there." She waved her arm vaguely into the distance. "I guess it probably died. It never cried or anything. Just sorta grinned at me, like some kinda weird monkey."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Male or female?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Oh, male, for sure. I could see its thing. It was bigger than Austen's, you know."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Why did you stop going to school recently?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "He told me to. Austen. He didn't say why."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I thought for a minute. No one in my family was religious, so I had never heard of Joseph Austen before Mrs. Sullivan mentioned him earlier, but it seemed like he was a pretty big deal in the community, so this story would be significant if it turned out to be true. The easiest way I could think of to verify it would be talking to Austen himself. Whether it was true or not, he would deny it, but the way he denied it could help me decide what spin to put on the story when I published it: innocent pastor unjustly maligned by conniving girl, or evil child molester accused by his first victim. </span></p><p class="P1"><span> The police could take it from there.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> But I'd prefer to catch him off guard when I brought it up, so his reaction would be as natural as possible. Mrs. Sullivan didn't seem to suspect anything, so the only one who might warn him was Amber Linney. How to find out.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I decided the direct way was best.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Amber, do you talk to Austen regularly?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "No, we haven't talked at all since he told me to quit school."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Are you planning to tell him you talked to me?"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "Why would I do a stupid thing like that? He sexed up all those little kids, and I wanna hammer him for it. I'd go to the cops myself, except they wouldn't believe me."</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I pointed out that the cops were ready to jump on even the slightest accusation of pedophilia nowadays in hopes of being heroes in the news, but</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "I lied to the cops that my mom was beating me up so they'd take me away from her, and they found out, so they don't believe anything I say anymore,"</span></p><p class="P1"><span> said Amber.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> I thanked her for her time and was about to leave, but she stopped me and said that she couldn't use the Internet and asked if I would send her a copy of the story when it was done. I said I would and also asked if I could find her here if I wanted to ask any more questions, and she said she would be, but she wasn't going to answer any more questions unless I brought her some Plan B and a carton of Virginia Slims.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> "If you bring me those pills, I might even use one for you," she added. I laughed nervously at that remark, trying to laugh like I wasn't nervous, and ran away, trying to look like I wasn't running away.</span></p><p class="P1"><span> Damn, even fourteen-year-old girls mess with me like that.</span></p></body></html>
