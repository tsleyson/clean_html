<h1>Fundamentals</h1>

<p>Use json to store a configuration to replace the characters.
Write a key-fn to translate the string names of the functions
into functions.
Also have to merge the files. Have to get rid of extra html, head, body etc. tags and the duplicated stylesheets.</p>

<h1>The configuration file</h1>

<p>A JSON file with the following fields:
- directory: Where your files are stored. Currently they all have to be under the same
  directory.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>order: A list of all your files, in the order you want them to be when merged.
If you're not merging, it doesn't matter what order they're in.</p></li>
<li><p>merge: Optional. If true, all the files in "order" will be merged into one file.
If false or absent, they won't be.</p></li>
</ul>
