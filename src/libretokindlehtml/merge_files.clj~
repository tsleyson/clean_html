; merge_files.clj
; These functions are for merging a bunch of html files into
; one html file. You can get a list of html files turned into
; a list of enlive resources, and you can get them all merged
; into one html resource which can be written back to a file
; by write-resource.
(in-ns 'libretokindlehtml.core)

; have to find some way to sort the files so they're in the correct order.
; The built-in sort sorts them lexicographically, so Chapter 10 
; comes after Chapter 1.
; Here's the idea:
; - Read the ordering from somwhere. For now I'm going to parse
; it out of the file name with regular expressions, but for
; e.g. Strawberry Sunflower that wouldn't work, so try to 
; leave an option to take the ordering as a map from somewhere.
; - Attach the position of the file in the ordering as metadata
; on the resource when the list of resources is constructed.
; - Write a comparator that sorts based on metadata position.
; - Sort and merge into a single html file.
; - Profit!!
